Subject: Assistance Needed with Course Project Topic Selection
Content:
Hi Professor Daniels,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm Tyler Chen, a sophomore in your Artificial Intelligence class (CS 305). As we're approaching the project proposal deadline, I am still a bit uncertain about my topic selection. I am interested in deep learning applications, but I am not sure how to narrow it down to a feasible project. Could I possibly schedule a meeting with you to discuss my ideas and get your insights? I am available on Monday and Wednesday afternoons or whenever it's convenient for you.

Looking forward to your guidance.

Warm regards,
Tyler Chen
