Subject: Difficulty Understanding Today's Lecture on Quantum Mechanics
Content:
Dear Prof. Singh,

This is Alex Rutherford from your Monday morning Quantum Physics class. I'll admit, I found today's lecture quite challenging to follow, specifically the section on wave-particle duality. Is there any chance I can get some extra material or recommended readings to help clarify the concept?

Thank you for your help.

Sincerely,
Alex Rutherford
