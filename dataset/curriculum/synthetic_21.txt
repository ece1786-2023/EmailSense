Subject: Group Project Submission Inquiry for Econ 101

Dear Dr. Havens,

I hope this message finds you well. I have a question regarding the group project for Econ 101. Our group is a bit confused about the submission process outlined on the course site. Are we required to submit a hard copy in class as well as the digital version on the online portal?

Also, could you please clarify if the project's appendix should include all the data tables we consulted, or is it sufficient to reference them in our analysis section?

Thank you for your guidance on this matter.

Best,
