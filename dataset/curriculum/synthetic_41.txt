Subject: Clarification Needed on Term Paper Guidelines

Dear Professor Smith,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm Jaime, one of your students in History 101, "World War I: Epochs and Impacts." I've started working on the term paper, and I'm a bit unclear on some of the guidelines outlined in the syllabus. Specifically, I'm not sure how you would like us to address counterfactual scenarios regarding the outcomes of the war. Could you please provide some guidance on how to integrate these scenarios with the historical facts?

Your assistance will be greatly appreciated as it will help me ensure my paper is on the right track.

Thank you for your time and help.

Best regards,
Jaime Roberts
