Subject: Questions about PSYC 1000 -002 exam

Dr. Smith,

Hello, this is Jane Doe, and I'm in your PSYC 1000 course (section 002). I looked over the test we got back in class today, and I have a few questions about things I got wrong. Can I come by during your office hours at 10:00 am tomorrow to discuss what I can do to improve my grade on the next test? If anther time would be better for you, just let me know and I will schedule an appointment.

Thanks for your help,

Jane
