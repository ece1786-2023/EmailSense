Dear Dr. Hoffstader
My name is Penny Smith, and I am in your French History
class.

I would like to schedule a meeting with you during your office hours on April 1, 2022. During our meeting, I would like to discuss some questions from our last lecture.

Please let me know if that day works for you or if another time is better. Thank you in advance for considering my request. Have a great day.

Sincerely
Penny Smith
