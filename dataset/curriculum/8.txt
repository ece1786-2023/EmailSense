Subject: Request for Textbook Information and Accessibility Accommodations

Content:

Dear Professor Anthony,
My name is Veronica, and I am in this section of that class. I have a file with Office of Disability Services and a 504 plan for low vision and testing accommodations. I need materials in a digital format so that I can enlarge them to a font size I can read. This will not be needed for exams, as I will be taking tests in the Office of Disability Services testing center. I also use various other assistive technologies, which I will bring on the first day. Iâ€™ve attached my faculty information sheet which contains additional information about my accommodations.

Before the semester starts, may I get the name/ISBN of the textbooks and other materials for the semester? I want to make sure I can have them in an accessible format for the first day of class.

Thanks,

Veronica
