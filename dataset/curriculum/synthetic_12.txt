Subject: Midterm Project Idea Approval - ECON 301

Content:
Professor Reyes,

I’m Samuel Kim from your ECON 301 course, and I’m emailing you to seek your approval for my midterm project idea. I’d like to analyze the economic impact of recent policy changes in the gig economy. Would this topic align with the course objectives, and could you provide any initial feedback or recommended resources?

I understand the project proposal deadline is tomorrow, so I would greatly appreciate it if you could provide your feedback by the end of today. Your prompt response will ensure that I have sufficient time to refine my proposal and adhere to the course timeline.

Appreciate your guidance,
Samuel Kim
