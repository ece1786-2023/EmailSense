Subject: Midterm Project Idea Approval - ECON 301
Content:
Professor Reyes,

I’m Samuel Kim from your ECON 301 course, and I’m emailing you to seek your approval for my midterm project idea. I’d like to analyze the economic impact of recent policy changes in the gig economy. Would this topic align with the course objectives, and could you provide any initial feedback or recommended resources?

Appreciate your guidance,
Samuel Kim
