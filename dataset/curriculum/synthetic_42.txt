Subject: Absence Due to Medical Emergency
Content:
Dear Professor Martins,

I am Andy Cho from your Philosophy 204 class. Unfortunately, I had an unexpected medical emergency this morning and had to go to the hospital, resulting in my absence from today's lecture. I have attached a note from the doctor. I am eager to catch up on what I missed and would like to inquire if there are any supplementary materials or notes that I could review.

Thank you for understanding.

Best regards,
Andy Cho
