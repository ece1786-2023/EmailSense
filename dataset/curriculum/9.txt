Content;

Dear Professor Smith,

My name is Marsha Lue, and I am in your FYE 1005 course that meets on Tuesday and Thursday from 11-11:50. I was writing in regards to the assignment due at the end of the course (Comprehensive Final Exam). To clarify, the final exam can be turned in on October 16th at 11 am?

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely, Marsha Lue
