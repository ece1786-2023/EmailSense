Subject: Group Project Peer Evaluation Concern

Dear Professor Smith,

I am Arnold, from your Tuesday 'Business Strategy' class at the London School of Economics. I hope you're doing well.

I'm emailing to express a concern about the peer evaluation for our upcoming group project. I find it unclear how our input will affect the final grade distribution among team members. Could you please clarify this during the next lecture or by email?

Thank you for your guidance and support.

Best regards,
Arnold Winchester
