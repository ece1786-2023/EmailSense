Subject: ENVS 210 - Missing Class Due to Medical Appointment
Content:
Dear Dr. Weaver,

I hope this message reaches you well. I'm Melanie Turner from your Environmental Science class, section 004. I wanted to inform you in advance that I will be missing class on April 14th due to a medical appointment that couldn't be rescheduled. I understand the importance of attendance and will ensure to catch up on the missed material. May I also request any handouts or assignments that I will miss that day?

Thank you for your understanding.

Warm regards,
Melanie Turner
