Subject: Lecture Slides for Econometrics Lecture 5 Missing from Portal
Content:
Good Evening Prof. Ramirez,

I hope you're having a pleasant day. I'm Alex Grant from your Monday Econometrics class. I noticed that the lecture slides for Lecture 5 aren't available on the course portal. They would be really helpful for reviewing this week's material and preparing for the upcoming quiz. If it's not too much trouble, could you please upload them or let us know if they're available elsewhere?

Thank you for your help with this.

Best wishes,
Alex Grant
