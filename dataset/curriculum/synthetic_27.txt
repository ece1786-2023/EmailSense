Subject: Inquiry About Possible Topics for Research Paper in Biology 320
Content:
Good afternoon Dr. Stein,

This is Kevin Luo from your Molecular Biology class. I have been brainstorming topics for our upcoming research paper and have narrowed it down to a few options. I would like to explore either the mechanisms of CRISPR-Cas9 or the latest advancements in stem cell therapy. Could you provide some feedback on which topic might be more appropriate for the scope of this assignment? Your input would be greatly appreciated.

Best wishes,
Kevin Luo
