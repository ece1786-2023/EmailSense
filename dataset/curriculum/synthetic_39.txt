Subject: Group Project Update and Request for Feedback
Content:
Hi Dr. Lewis,

I'm George, from your Business Strategy seminar. I wanted to update you on our group project. We have chosen Tesla's market entry strategy in China as our case study and outlined the main points for our presentation. We'd appreciate it if you could provide some initial feedback on our approach before we delve deeper into the research. Is it possible to meet during your office hours next week?

Best,
George B.
