Subject: Urgent: Possible Typo in Calculus II Homework Set #3

Content:
Dr. Patel,

I believe there's a typo in question 4b of Homework Set #3 for our Calculus II class. The formula provided doesn't align with the examples from our textbook. Could you clarify this for us? As the homework is due tomorrow, could you please confirm if the current formula is a mistake as soon as possible, so we can complete the assignment correctly and on time?

Thank you,
Connor Zhao

P.S. If it's not too much trouble, an email response before the end of today or an early update tomorrow would be greatly appreciated, considering the approaching deadline.
