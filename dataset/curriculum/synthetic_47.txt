Subject: Possible Typo in Calculus II Homework Set #3
Content:
Dr. Patel,

I believe there's a typo in question 4b of Homework Set #3 for our Calculus II class. The formula provided doesn't align with the examples from our textbook. Could you clarify this for us during the next lecture?

Thank you,
Connor Zhao
