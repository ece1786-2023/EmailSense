Subject: Group Project Member Not Contributing
Content:
Professor Kingston,

I'm reaching out concerning an issue our group is experiencing in your Marketing Strategy class. I'm Sarah McLean, and our group is currently working on the final project. Unfortunately, one of our members has not been participating or responding to messages, leaving us short-handed. We have tried multiple ways to engage them, but with no success. I wanted to seek your advice on how we should proceed. We are committed to delivering a quality project, but we are concerned about the workload distribution.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Best,
Sarah McLean
