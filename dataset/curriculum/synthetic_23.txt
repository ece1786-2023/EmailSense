Subject: Group Project Member Not Contributing

Content:
Professor Kingston,

I'm reaching out concerning an issue our group is experiencing in your Marketing Strategy class. I'm Sarah McLean, and our group is currently working on the final project. Unfortunately, one of our members has not been participating or responding to messages, leaving us short-handed. We have tried multiple ways to engage them, but with no success. As the project deadline is approaching next week, this matter has become quite urgent. I wanted to seek your advice on how we should proceed. We are committed to delivering a quality project, but we are concerned about the workload distribution. Could we possibly meet tomorrow or by the end of this week to discuss potential solutions?

Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter. Your timely advice would be greatly appreciated to ensure we stay on track for the deadline.

Best,
Sarah McLean
