Subject: Discussion Group Leader Volunteering for PSY 310
Content:
Hi Professor Jenkins,

Hope your week is going well! I'm Maxine Lowell, a junior, and an enthusiastic participant in your PSY 310: Cognitive Behavior class. I'm really enjoying the material, and I was wondering if you might need a student leader for any of the upcoming discussion groups? I'd love to volunteer for this role and assist in facilitating some of our class conversations.

Looking forward to your thoughts on this.

Best,
Maxine Lowell
