Subject: Office Hours Appointment for HW Assistance

Content:
Prof. Lee,

My name is Sophie and I'm in your COMPSCI 101 class, TTh 2-4 PM. I've been struggling with the latest programming assignment and would benefit from some one-on-one help. When would it be possible to meet during your office hours this week? As the assignment is due this Friday, I am hoping to meet with you as soon as possible, preferably within the next two days, to resolve the issues I'm facing and ensure I can submit it on time.

I am available for any slot you can offer and will prioritize this meeting. Your prompt response would be greatly appreciated due to the time-sensitive nature of the assistance needed.

Looking forward to your response.

Warm regards,

Sophie Graham
