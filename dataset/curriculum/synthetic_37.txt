Prof. Lee,

My name is Sophie and I'm in your COMPSCI 101 class, TTh 2-4 PM. I've been struggling with the latest programming assignment and would benefit from some one-on-one help. When would it be possible to meet during your office hours this week?

Looking forward to your response.

Warm regards,

Sophie Graham
