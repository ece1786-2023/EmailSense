Subject: Urgent Clarification Needed on Project Deadline
Content:
Dear Professor Lawrence,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm Alex Johnson from your HIS 340: Modern World History class.

I am writing to urgently seek clarification regarding the final project deadline. The syllabus mentions the due date as December 5th, but in the last class, you mentioned December 3rd as the deadline. This discrepancy is causing significant confusion among the class members.

Considering the complexity of the project and the need to coordinate with group members, it is critical for us to have a clear and definitive deadline as soon as possible. A prompt response will greatly assist us in effectively planning and allocating the remaining time to ensure the quality of our submission.

Thank you for your understanding and swift attention to this matter.

Best regards,

Alex Johnson
