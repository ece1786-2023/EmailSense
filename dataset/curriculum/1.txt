Subject: Clarification on Final Essay Deadline for Old English Course (Section 1)

Content:

Dear Dr. Toswell,

My name is Jes D.A., and I'm in Section 1 of your Old English course (on Tuesdays at 10:00 a.m.). After looking over the syllabus last night, I noticed that the deadline for our final essay is listed as March 7, which is a Monday.

However, in class, the deadline was noted as being Thursday, March 10. I don't mean to bother you, but I wanted to verify the correct deadline so that I can appropriately organize my schedule and turn in my assignment on time. Thank you so much for your time and patience!

Best regards,

Jes D.A.
