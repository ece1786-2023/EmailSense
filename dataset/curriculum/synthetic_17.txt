Subject: Special Topics Seminar in Philosophy - Pre-Enrollment Query
Content:
Dr. Khaled,

Good afternoon. This is Leila Ahmed, a senior philosophy major. I'm considering enrolling in your Special Topics Seminar next term, and I'm curious about the themes we'll be tackling. Could you please shed some light on the subjects we will explore, and how they tie into contemporary philosophical debates?

Warm regards,
Leila Ahmed
