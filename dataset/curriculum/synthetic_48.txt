Subject: Project Deadline Extension Request - COMP SCI 455
Content:
Dear Dr. Green,

The members of my group project in your Advanced Algorithms class have come down with a flu. We've made significant progress on the code, but could use a couple extra days to recuperate and finalize our work. Would an extension to November 22 be possible?

Given the approaching deadline, we would greatly appreciate a prompt response to this request, so we can manage our work schedule effectively and ensure the high quality of our final submission.

Warm regards,
Annie Hu
