Subject: BIO 332 Lab Equipment Handling Concern
Content:
Dear Professor Hughes,

During yesterday's BIO 332 lab session, I noticed that some of the microscopes seem to be mishandled by students unfamiliar with the proper procedures, possibly affecting their performance. As someone passionate about our lab work, I'd like to suggest a quick refresher or tutorial at the beginning of our next lab. I believe it would be beneficial for all.

Thank you for considering this,
Jamie Winters
