Subject: Clarification Needed on Group Project Guidelines for MKT 450
Content:
Hi Dr. Lee,

Iâ€™m Tim Horton from the Thursday section of your MKT 450 Brand Management class. My group and I are a bit confused about the scope of the upcoming group project. Specifically, are we required to conduct primary market research, or is secondary research sufficient for the purpose of our analysis?

Many thanks for your time,
Tim Horton
