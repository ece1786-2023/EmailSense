Subject: Group Project Conflict in Business Strategy Course
Content:
Professor Lawrence,

Our group for the Business Strategy presentation seems to be having some issues dividing tasks fairly. Iâ€™ve attempted to resolve it internally, but we could use some mediation. Could you possibly offer some advice during the next class or office hours?

Kind regards,
Omar Said
