Subject: ECE1756 Lab 3 Extension Request

Content:

Dear Professor  Betz,

I hope this email finds you well.

I have just noticed that I have mistakenly remembered the deadline for Lab 3. I downloaded the lab instruction pdf when it first came out, and the deadline written on it was November 29, then I was sick for the reading break and the illness stuck with me until today, I was also overwhelmed with my other deadlines at the same time. 

I did not notice that the deadline is Wednesday until today. I am sorry for my ignorance. I really want to do well in this assignment. Therefore, I hope you'll be able to extend the deadline and allow some extra time.

Sincerely,

Isabella Hao
