Subject: VAM 102- paper extension

Content:

Dear Dr. Van Helsing,

My name is Jack Seward, and I'm in your 12:00 Better Living Through Garlic (VAM 102) course. I've been sick for the past few days, and was hoping that I could get an extension on my paper. I currently have four pages written, but need a little extra time to work on the conclusion. Is there any way I could get an extension and turn it in the morning of the 28th?

I understand the importance of meeting deadlines and would greatly appreciate a prompt response to plan accordingly and ensure the quality of my work.

Thanks,

Jack Seward
