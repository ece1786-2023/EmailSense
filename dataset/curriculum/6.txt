Content:

Dear Mr. Jones,
My name is DongMin Kim from your Advanced Conversation class 12345. My student number is 200811111. My class name is Ricky. I am writing to apologize for being absent from class on Monday.

I visited my hometown and unfortunately could not return to Ansan on time.

If there is anything I need to catch up on, please let me know.

Once again, I am sorry for missing our class.

Yours sincerely,

DongMin Kim
