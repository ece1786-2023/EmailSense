Subject: Attendance Inquiry for Hist 105 â€“ 17th Century European History
Content:
Hello Dr. Cartwright,

My name is Arjun Patel, and I am a student in your Monday 9 AM section of Hist 105: 17th Century European History. I am reaching out because I recently had an unexpected family emergency that requires me to travel this coming week. I wanted to know what the protocol is for making up any missed work or notes from the lectures I will be absent from. Also, I would be grateful if you could share any slides or resources that could assist me in keeping up with the class.

Thank you for understanding,
Arjun Patel
