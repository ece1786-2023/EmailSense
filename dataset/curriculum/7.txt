Subject: Energy and Environmental Justice

Professor Folch,

How are you? My name is Gary and I am a student here at Duke, looking at what to take next semester. Your course on Energy and Environmental Justice caught my eye. I was wondering if you would be able to send me any sort of sample syllabus or reading list so that I could get a better idea of if the class is right for me.

Thanks,

Gary
