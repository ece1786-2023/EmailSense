Subject: Issue Accessing Online Homework Platform
Content:
Professor Green,

This is Ryan Zheng from your Statistics 101 class. I am experiencing difficulty accessing the online homework platform; it seems my login credentials are not being recognized. I've attempted to reset my password, but the issue persists. As the next assignment is due soon, I'm concerned about falling behind. Could you please advise on how I might resolve this issue or whom I should contact for technical support?

Thank you for your assistance.

Best,
Ryan Zheng
