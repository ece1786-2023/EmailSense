Subject: ENGL 12: Citation Style Preference for Paper 1

Content:

Dear Professor Gonzalez,

I'm in your ENGL 12 Sec.002 course in Building 1, TTH from 1-3 pm.

For our literature review assignment due Sept. 30, which citation style
should we use? APA, MLA, or another style?

Thanks for your time and help!

Sincerely, Mindy Manners
