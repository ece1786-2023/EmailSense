Content:
Dear Professor Smith,

My name is Lexie Brown, from History 1B, Section 1. I was wondering if we could set up an appointment to discuss my grade on Assignment 1. I have checked that your office hours are scheduled on Wednesdays from 2 to 5 PM. If this is correct, please let me know if I can come. I look forward to your reply.

Kind regards,
Lexie Brown
