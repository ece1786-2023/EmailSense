Subject: Request for Lecture Slides
Content:
Prof. White,

I'm Lisa from your Art History 101 class, Friday sessions. Unfortunately, I couldn't attend the last lecture due to illness. May I request the slides presented on Baroque art so I can catch up before the next class?

Thank you for your understanding.
