Subject: Confusion on Course Assignment Guidelines
Content:
Hello Dr. Klein,

This is Mike from your ECON 2001 class. There seems to be some confusion regarding the guidelines for our term paper. The assignment sheet specifies a maximum of 10 pages, but during lecture, you mentioned 15 pages. Could you clarify which it is?

Thanks in advance,

Mike Harrington
