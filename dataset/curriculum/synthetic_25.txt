Subject: Office Hours Conflict with Work Schedule
Content:
Hello Professor Blackwell,

My name is Chloe Adams, from your International Law course. Unfortunately, I've run into a scheduling conflict as I work part-time during your office hours. I really need some clarification on last week's lecture regarding trade agreements, and I was wondering if there's any chance we could meet at an alternate time. I have availability on Tuesday and Thursday mornings if that works for you.

Thank you for considering my request.

Best,
Chloe Adams
