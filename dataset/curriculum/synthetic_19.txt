Subject: Group Project Concerns and Participation

Hey Dr. Kingsley,

I hope you're doing well. I've been following the syllabus for BIO-310 pretty closely and noticed that the group project deadline is coming up in two weeks. I'm reaching out because there seems to be a bit of an issue with my group. Two of our members, including myself, have been active in planning and research, but the other two haven't been participating at all.

We've tried reaching out multiple times and have had no response. I'm concerned about our ability to meet the project expectations with half of our group missing in action. Is there a way for us to address this situation with you or could you offer any advice on how to proceed? I'm worried this may impact the quality of what we can deliver.

Thanks for your time,
