Subject: Accommodation Request for Religious Observance
Content:
Good afternoon Professor Carter,

I am Naomi Klein from your Cultural Anthropology section. As Yom Kippur is approaching, I will be observing this holiday, which will coincide with our class's scheduled exam on October 4th. I wanted to inquire if there is a possibility of taking the exam on an alternative date due to my religious commitments.

Thank you for considering my request.

Respectfully,
Naomi Klein
