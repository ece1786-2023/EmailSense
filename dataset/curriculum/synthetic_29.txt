Subject: Incomplete Lecture Notes for Chem340
Content:
Prof. Johnson,

Danny Ray here, from the Chem340 class on MWF at 11:00 am. I'm reaching out because I had to leave our last session early due to a family emergency. I was wondering if you might have the lecture notes available for the last 20 minutes of class. I'm afraid of falling behind.

I would be very grateful if you could share these with me. Thank you for your assistance.

Best,
Danny Ray
