Subject: Confusion Regarding Midterm Exam Coverage
Content:
Hey Professor Ramirez,

Just a quick question: I'm Kyle from your 9 am Calculus II class. Regarding the upcoming midterm, I was wondering if you could specify the chapters we need to focus on? Your last lecture mentioned chapters 4 through 6, but the syllabus says up to chapter 5. Could you clarify this for us?

Cheers,
Kyle H.
