Subject: Absence due to Family Emergency
Content:
Hi Professor Sanders,

I'm Anita in your Biol 202 Thursday lab section. Unfortunately, I had a family emergency this weekend and will need to miss class this week. I've read the syllabus about missed labs and would like to discuss making up this week's lab session.

Hope to hear back soon,

Anita Rivera
