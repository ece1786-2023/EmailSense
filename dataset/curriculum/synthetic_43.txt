Subject: Unexpected Absence - Econometrics Lecture
Content:
Dear Professor Montgomery,

I regret to inform you that I won't be able to attend the next two Econometrics lectures due to a family emergency. I've always been present and taken notes diligently. Is there a classmate you could recommend I get notes from or any supplementary materials you could share?

Thank you for understanding,
Rachel Nguyen
