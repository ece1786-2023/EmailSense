Subject: Unexpected Health Issues and Class Participation
Content:
Dear Professor Morris,

I am Sheryl from your PSYCH 210 Monday session. Due to some recent health developments, I may have to miss a few upcoming classes. I wanted to ensure that this won't significantly impact my participation grade and discuss alternative ways to contribute.

Best,

Sheryl Watkins
