Hello Dr. Hernandez,

This is Samantha Lee from the Tuesday section of Molecular Biology (BIO 310). I'm having trouble accessing the lecture slides from last week on the course website. Could you please check if they're uploaded correctly or advise on another way to get them?

Thank you,
Samantha Lee
