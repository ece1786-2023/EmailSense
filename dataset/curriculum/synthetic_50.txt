Subject: Discussion Section Inquiry
Content:
Dear Professor Nguyen,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to reach out to inquire about the upcoming discussion section for our Sociology of Gender course. I've been enjoying the lectures and readings so far, but I have some questions that I feel would be better addressed during a smaller group setting.

Could you please let me know when the next discussion section is scheduled, and if there is any particular reading we should focus on before attending? Additionally, is it possible to switch to a different discussion section as the current time slot clashes with another one of my courses?

Thank you for your time and guidance. I look forward to your response.

Best regards,
Sophia Mitchell
