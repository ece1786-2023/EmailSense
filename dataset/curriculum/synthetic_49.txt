Subject: Literature Review Feedback for English Modernism
Content:
Dr. Keller,

I hope you're doing well. I'd like to request feedback on my draft for the literature review in our English Modernism class. I've tried to incorporate a variety of perspectives, but Iâ€™m not sure if the argument is cohesive. When would be a good time to discuss this?

Best wishes,
Jordan Matthews
