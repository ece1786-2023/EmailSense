Dear Professor Niv,
 
I hope this email finds you well. Our team (Shi Tang - 1005930619; Dechen Han - 1006095636; Weizhou Wang - 1004421262) are writing to request a short extension for our project, currently due on Friday, Dec 1.
 
Since our team members are in the midst of handling graduate school applications, with several deadlines on this Friday, and are managing assignments from other courses. Although we have been making steady progress on our project, we might need more time to finalize our code and report.
 
Therefore, we humbly request an extension for the project. We believe that a few additional days would significantly enhance the quality of our work, allowing us to conduct more comprehensive benchmark testing and to finalize our report.
 
Thank you very much for considering our request. We look forward to your response.
 
Sincerely,
Shi (Tiffany) Tang
