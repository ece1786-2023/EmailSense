Subject: Quick Query: Material Science Expertise for Joint Venture

Content:
Hi Prof. Smith,

Mark Linton here from BioComposites Inc. – stumbled upon your work on biodegradable materials, and I'm intrigued! We’re venturing into sustainable packaging solutions and seeking an academic partner for some insight on material science.

Fancy a coffee next week to chat about this? Could be the start of something exciting!

Cheers,
