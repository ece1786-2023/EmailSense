Subject: Thanks for the Enlightening Meeting

Content:
Hi Dr. Cohen,

I just wanted to drop a quick thank you note for taking the time yesterday to discuss the potential for collaboration between MIT's engineering department and Lunar Dynamics. Your perspective on sustainable energy solutions was incredibly enlightening and aligns perfectly with our mission at Lunar Dynamics.

The team and I left the meeting buzzing with ideas, and we're excited at the prospect of what we can achieve together. We'll start drafting a formal collaboration proposal and aim to have it in your inbox by next Thursday.

Thanks once again for sharing your valuable time and insights.

Best,
Tom Clarkson
Head of R&D Partnerships, Lunar Dynamics
