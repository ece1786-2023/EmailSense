Subject: Gratitude for Your Expert Guidance in Research Project Development
Content:
Dear Eric Vance:

I am writing in response to your invaluable assistance with my research
project development. I must also express my gratitude to Phil Turk,
Associate Professor, College of Natural Sciences, Statistics, Colorado
State University, for forwarding me to you.

I would not have been able to adequately complete my application without
your assistance in identifying the proper statistic to utilize for my
study comparing our clinic's treatment results against a benchmark
study's reported results.

I am especially appreciative of the time taken utilizing Skype
videoconferencing to help hone my research query and study purpose
statement so the one accurately describes the variable to be studied and
the latter concisely captures the clinical relevance.

Sincerely,

Anthony Johnston, BSN, RN, ACHRN

Hyperbaric Safety Director, Hyperbaric Medicine
