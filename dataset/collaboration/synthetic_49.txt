Dear Professor Brown,

I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks for the insightful discussion we had last Tuesday. Your perspective on quantum computing applications in the finance sector is intriguing, and we at Quantum Solutions are eager to see how a partnership could benefit both of our organizations.

As discussed, our team will prepare a detailed proposal outlining the scope of potential collaborative research. You can expect to receive this by the end of the month. Meanwhile, if you have any further thoughts or require additional information, please do not hesitate to reach out.

Thank you once again for considering this opportunity. We are looking forward to the prospect of working together.

Warm regards,
Susan Lee
