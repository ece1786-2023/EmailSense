The workshop will take place on July 15th, 2023, at our headquarters in Boston, and we will cover all travel and accommodation expenses. Your insights into predictive modeling in biological systems would be a highlight for our attendees.

Please let me know if you are available and interested. Your contribution could spark innovative approaches within our industry.

Looking forward to your reply.
