Dear Prof. Johnson,

I wanted to extend a heartfelt thank you for the enlightening conversation we had last week regarding the potential for a joint venture between your lab and our company, Intrepid Innovations.

Your perspective on applying advanced materials in aeronautics resonated with our team, and we are excited about the possibility of combining our resources with your cutting-edge research.

As discussed, we will prepare a draft of a collaboration agreement and send it over for your review by next Wednesday.

Again, thank you for your time and I look forward to shaping the future of aerospace together.

Warmest regards,

Megan Zhao
Chief Technology Officer
