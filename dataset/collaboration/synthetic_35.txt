Subject: Thank You for Your Insightful Lecture on AI Ethics

Professor Clarke,

I wanted to extend my heartfelt thanks for the lecture you delivered last Thursday on AI ethics at our companyâ€™s tech day. Your talk sparked a lot of discussion among our engineering teams, and it was exactly the kind of thought-provoking content we needed.

As discussed, I believe there's ample opportunity for our paths to cross again, perhaps through a joint research initiative or speaking engagement. The intersection of ethical considerations and artificial intelligence is critical to our work at NeuralMind Tech, and your expertise would be invaluable.

Let's keep in touch and explore ways to work together in the future.

Sincerely,

Natalie Portman
Chief Ethics Officer
