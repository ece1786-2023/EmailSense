Dear Professor Anderson,

I'm reaching out on behalf of Robotics Solutions Inc. to express our interest in forming a partnership with your laboratory. Our company is dedicated to developing cutting-edge robotics systems, and we believe that a collaboration could lead to innovative projects with great potential for commercialization.

We are particularly interested in your work with adaptive robotics and think there could be synergies with our current product development strategy. Could we arrange a time to meet and discuss potential areas of collaboration in more detail?

We are looking forward to the possibility of a fruitful partnership.

Best regards,

Linda Choi
