Dear Dr. Miller,

Greetings from GreenMaterials Co.! As a leading company in sustainable material development, we've been closely following your impressive work on biodegradable polymers at the University of EcoInnovations. We're particularly excited about your recent breakthroughs in creating materials with a lower environmental footprint.

We are currently seeking academic partners for a project that aims to integrate these novel biodegradable materials into consumer products. Given your expertise, we'd be thrilled to discuss the possibility of you leading the academic research aspect of this initiative.

Would it be possible to arrange a meeting to further explore this opportunity? We're confident that a collaboration could lead to significant advancements in sustainable material science.

I look forward to your thoughts.

Best regards,

Samantha Kuo
