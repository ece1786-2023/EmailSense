Hey Prof. Lee,

Loved your TED talk on AI ethics – it was a game-changer! 👏👏👏

I'm Jamie, a data scientist over at ByteSmart. We're cooking up some AI projects that could really benefit from a dose of your ethical insights. Thinking we could make something awesome together!

How about grabbing a coffee next Thursday? Let's brainstorm!

Cheers,
Jamie
