Hello Prof. Johnson,

I just wanted to drop you a quick thank you note following our meeting yesterday. It was great to learn more about your work on sustainable energy systems at MIT.

I'm excited about the potential for our companies to collaborate on the development of the new solar-powered engine we discussed. I've already briefed my team at SunPower Innovations, and they are eager to start exploring the possibilities.

Please send over any initial data or research that you think would be relevant for us to review before we set up the technical deep-dive session with our engineers.

Again, many thanks for your time, and I'm looking forward to what we can achieve together.

Warm regards,
Emily Cho
Lead Project Manager, SunPower Innovations
