Dr. Roberts,

Greetings from Visionary Electronics! My name is Steve Harper, and I'm the event coordinator for TechFusion 2023, the premier technology conference happening in San Francisco this July.

We have been keeping an eye on your pioneering work in wearable technology and would be thrilled if you could present your findings at our event. Your insights would be invaluable to our audience of industry professionals and fellow academics.

We offer an honorarium for our speakers, and of course, will cover all travel and accommodation expenses. Please let me know if you would be interested in this opportunity so we can discuss the details.

Cheers,
Steve Harper
Event Coordinator, TechFusion 2023
