I am writing to inquire about the possibility of joining your team as a postdoc. I have a few ideas for projects that could align well with your current research focus and would be thrilled to contribute to your lab's mission.

I have attached my CV and would be happy to provide references and a research proposal at your convenience. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to your team.

Best,
