Hello Dr. Johnson,

I'm writing to you as the Project Manager from AutoSense Tech, a leading company specializing in advanced sensor technology for the automotive industry. We are currently forming a consortium to work on a cutting-edge project aimed at developing next-generation sensors for autonomous vehicles, and your expertise in sensor data fusion is invaluable.

Given the scope and innovative nature of this project, we are selectively inviting key experts and academic leaders to join us. We believe that your participation would greatly enhance the project's success. Could we schedule a call to discuss the potential for your involvement and any terms or resources that might be required?

Please note that we have a consortium kick-off meeting scheduled for April 15th, and we would need your confirmation of participation by the end of the day on April 10th to ensure we have all necessary logistics in place. Additionally, there will be a preliminary online briefing on April 8th, which will provide crucial context for the kick-off meeting; your early confirmation would allow us to include you in this briefing.

To accommodate the schedule of our international partners and ensure a timely start, it is imperative that we finalize the list of participants within the next 48 hours. Your immediate attention to this matter would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for considering our invitation. I look forward to hearing from you soon and hope to have your prompt response.

Best,
Jessica Hales
Project Manager, AutoSense Tech
