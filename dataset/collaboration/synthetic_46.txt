Subject: Initial Inquiry: Potential Collaboration with Acme Robotics

Content:
Dear Professor Smith,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is John Carter, and I am the Head of Research and Development at Acme Robotics. We are currently exploring the possibility of integrating advanced AI algorithms into our next generation of industrial robotic systems.

Having followed your work in AI-powered autonomous systems, we believe that your expertise could be incredibly valuable in pushing the boundaries of what we can achieve. We are particularly interested in your recent research on reinforcement learning and its applications in real-world scenarios.

Could we arrange a meeting to discuss potential collaboration opportunities? We are keen to explore how we could work together to innovate in this space. 

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,
John Carter
Head of R&D, Acme Robotics
