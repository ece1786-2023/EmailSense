Dear. Dr. Siegel:

This letter is to confirm Citigroup's interest in collaboration on the
research proposed under the title

"Laboratory for Information Globalization and Harmonization
Technologies"

Citigroup is a worldwide financial services corporation operating in
over 100 countries. We have a keen interest in understanding information
in the domain of international relations. Understanding this information
requires complex issues in intelligent integration of information.

The research proposed under this effort would help us provide such
services to applications in the international domain throughout
operations at the bank. Thus we have committed to provide support in the
form of external reviewers and sample applications that would be of
interest to Citigroup and relevant to this research effort. We plan to
be actively involved in this research, providing insight on areas that
we see as challenging and applying the theories, methodologies and
technologies developed under this research where they can help us in our
operations. We look forward to this cooperation with the principal
investigators and the National Science Foundation.

Sincerely,

Daniel Schutzer

Vice President

Emerging Technology Group
