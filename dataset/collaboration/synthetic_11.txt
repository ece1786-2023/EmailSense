Dear Prof. Johnson,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm Dr. Emily Harris, Head of Research at GreenTech Innovations. I recently came across your pioneering research on renewable energy sources, and I was highly impressed by your work on solar cell efficiency.

Our company is on the brink of initiating a new project aimed at developing low-cost, high-efficiency photovoltaic cells, and we believe your expertise would be invaluable in this endeavor. Would you be interested in exploring a potential collaboration with us?

Please let me know if you're open to a brief meeting to discuss this further. Looking forward to the possibility of working together.

Best regards,
Dr. Emily Harris
