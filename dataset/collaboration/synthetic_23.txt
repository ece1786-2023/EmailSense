Subject: Request for Material Testing Collaboration

Content:
Hi Prof. Williams,

I'm reaching out because we've hit a bit of a wall with some material testing and I immediately thought of your work at XYZ University. I'm Jamie from ProMaterials Inc., and we're trying to validate the durability of a new polymer blend we've developed.

We lack the sophisticated equipment available at your lab and were wondering if you'd be willing to help us test these materials. We think the data could be beneficial for both our company and your research. Plus, there might be room for a co-authored publication if you're interested.

Let me know if you'd like to chat more about this. 

Cheers,
Jamie Knox
