Subject: Interest in Collaborating on LIGHTS Research from CITM
Content:
Dear Dr. Wang:

This letter is to confirm our interest at the Fisher Center for
Information Technology & Marketplace

Transformation (CITM) in collaboration with you on the research
described in your proposal entitled

"Laboratory for Information Globalization and Harmonization Technologies
(LIGHTS)". I feel that the research you propose will have applicability
to a number of efforts within CITM with which we at Haas School of
Business are actively involved.

CITM has a keen interest in understanding information and information
technology in the domain of international relations, and would greatly
benefit from the result of research on the complex issues raised in the
intelligent integration of information that this project proposed. This
enhanced understanding of information technology applications in the
international domain would help us better serve the diverse community at
the Haas School of Business.

I would be pleased to be actively involved in this research by providing
support in the form of external reviewers, offering insights and inputs
on areas that we see as challenging, and applying theories,
methodologies and technologies developed under this research.

Sincerely,

Arie Segev

Professor and Director
