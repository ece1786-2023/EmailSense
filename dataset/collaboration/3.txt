Subject: Expression of Interest in Collaborative Research on Information Globalization and Harmonization Technologies
Content:
Dear Professor Choucri,

This letter is to confirm my interest in collaborating on the research
proposed under the title "Laboratory for Information Globalization and
Harmonization Technologies".

AT&T is a worldwide corporation with operations in many countries around
the globe.

We have a keen interest in understanding information and information
technology in the domain of international relations and certainly
appreciate the complex issues raised in the intelligent integration of
information raised by this process. As you know, for many years now, I
have been tracking many issues of this type, and the potential for
synergy are thus great.

The research proposed under this effort would help us better understand
information technology applications in the international domain
throughout our operations. Thus, I would be glad to provide support in
the form of external reviewers and engage in exchanges about potential
sample applications that would be of interest to us and relevant to this
research effort. I would be pleased to be actively involved in this
research, providing insight and inputs on areas that we see as
challenging and applying the theories, methodologies, and technologies
developed under this research where they can help us think out the
contours of alternative futures and of collaboration in the domain of
new information technologies.

I look forward to this cooperation with you and your colleagues.

Sincerely,

Braden R. Allenby
