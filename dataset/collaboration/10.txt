Dear Professor Madnick,

This letter is to confirm our commitment to collaborate with you on the
rescarch described in your proposal entitled "Laboratory for Information
Globalization and Harmonization Technologies and Studies".

As you well know, we have a strong interest in the applications of
intelligent integration of information in novel areas that have great
societal impacts. We believe that International Relations (IR) is indeed
one such area of application. In addition, having experienced the
utility of COIN, the idea of SHIP as the next-generation technology of
the same nature is also very exciting to us.

Overall, we feel that the research proposed under this effort would help
us better understand the problem of applying intelligent information
integration within diverse contexts. Thus we are pleased to give any
type of research support in the areas which are deemed appropriate for
us.

We look forward to an active role in this collaboration.

Yours sincerely,

Dr. Nor Adnan Yahaya
