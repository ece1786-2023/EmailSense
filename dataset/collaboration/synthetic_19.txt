Subject: Request for Expertise in Deep Learning Project

Content:
Hey Professor Davies,

I got your contact from Dr. Watson at the Deep Learning Conference last month. He mentioned you're the go-to person for deep learning applications in natural language processing.

I'm reaching out from NeuralTech AI because we are hitting a roadblock in our current project, where we're trying to develop an algorithm that can understand and summarize academic papers.

Would you be interested in consulting with us? Your insights could be just what we need to get this project off the ground. If you're too busy for a formal commitment, even a brief consultation or pointing us in the direction of relevant resources would be a tremendous help.

Thanks a bunch,
Jordan Michaels
