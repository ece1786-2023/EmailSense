Subject: Industry-Academia Collaboration Inquiry

Content:
Hi Prof. Adams,

Dan here from TechBridge Solutions. We've been diving into new IoT solutions for smart buildings, and your recent work on network security protocols for IoT devices has caught our attention.

I'm reaching out to see if you'd be interested in a casual chat about a possible collaboration. Our team is keen to tap into your academic insights to enhance our products' security features. If this sounds like something up your alley, maybe we could grab a coffee sometime next week?

Let me know if you're up for it or if there's a better way to connect.

Cheers,
Dan Wilson
