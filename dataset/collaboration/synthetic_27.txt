Subject: Inquiry: Joint Grant Application with Acme Biotech

Content:
Hi Dr. Jones,

I'm Dr. Michael Chen, a fellow in microbial genetics at Acme Biotech. I came across your recent publication on antibiotic resistance and believe there's a synergy between our research interests.

I'm writing to see if you'd be interested in collaborating on a joint grant application for the upcoming NIH call on 'Innovative Strategies Against Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria'. I feel our combined expertise could make for a compelling case.

Let's set up a time to chat? How does your schedule look next week?

Best,
Michael
