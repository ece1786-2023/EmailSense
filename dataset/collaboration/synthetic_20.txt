Subject: Quick Intro – SmartMed & Biomedical Engineering Collaboration

Prof. Anderson,

I'll keep this brief. I’m Jane Lee, the CEO of SmartMed Tech, a startup specializing in smart medical devices. We're exploring a new project that aligns with your biomedical engineering lab's work at UCLA.

The project is in its infancy, but we think your research on bio-signal processing could play a crucial role. Would you be interested in a short exploratory discussion?

I can drop by your office next Thursday or do a quick call whenever you're free.

Cheers,
Jane Lee
CEO, SmartMed Tech
