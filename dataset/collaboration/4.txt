Subject: Commitment to Collaborate on Information Globalization and Harmonization Technologies and Studies Research
Content:
Dear Professor Choucri:

This letter is to confirm my commitment to collaborate on the research
proposed entitled "Laboratory for Information Globalization and
Harmonization Technologies and Studies"

The American University of Beirut is a leading institution not only in
the Arab World, but in the entire Middle East. We have a keen interest
in understanding information and information technology, in key domains
central to the region's development. We certainly appreciate the value
of intelligent integration of information. The proposed research
directions would help us focus better on information technology
applications in different contexts.

Our collaboration with your research team over the past several years
has proved to be very important for all of us and for the multilingual
applications of GSSD. Arabic is a complex language, and this complexity
invariably affects the provision of local information into global
networks. Facilitating cross-source convergence and/or coherence across
data sets is rather central. For this reason, I would be interested in
exploring sample applications of this research effort and, to the extent
feasible, to do some 'test-bed' tasks (or experiments) as well.

I look forward to active participation in this research initiative, on
both the

'technology' as well as the 'studies sides.

Sincerely

Toufic Mezher

Associate Professor of Engineering Management
