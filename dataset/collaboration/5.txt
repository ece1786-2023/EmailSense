Subject: URGENT: Confirmation of Collaboration on Information Globalization and Harmonization Research

Dear Professor Choucri,

The purpose of this letter is to confirm our interest in a collaboration on the research proposed under the title "Laboratory for Information Globalization and Harmonization Technologies and Studies".

Baker & McKenzie is an international law firm of many nationalities with offices in more than 35 countries. We are highly interested in a better understanding of how to organize information and information technology in international relations and its effect on businesses.

Please note that our firm is currently in a crucial planning phase for the upcoming fiscal year, and aligning our research initiatives is of the utmost urgency. It is essential that we receive confirmation from your end by the end of this week to ensure our objectives are synchronized and resources are allocated appropriately.

We would be pleased to help with the proposed research by providing support as external reviewers and participating in discussions about potential sample applications which should be of interest to us and relevant to this research effort, such as implications for contentions surrounding property rights. As you know, I am personally interested in problems related to cross-cultural, multi-lingual, and multi-disciplinary communication.

Additionally, it is imperative that we schedule our initial meeting by no later than the 15th of this month due to the tight schedule of our senior management team. This will allow us to set a strategic direction for our collaborative work without any delays.

I look forward to an active role in this collaboration.

Sincerely,

Wallace R. Baker
