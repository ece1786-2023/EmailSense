Hello Professor Daniels,

I'm reaching out to you as the lead environmental engineer at OceanTech. We've been tasked with a project aimed at reducing the ecological footprint of offshore platforms and your pioneering research in environmental impact assessment has caught our eye.

Would you be open to a consultancy role where your insights could guide our project's direction? We believe your contribution could be critical to our success.

Let's connect to discuss this further. Your knowledge could make a real difference in preserving our oceans.

Sincerely,

Luisa Ramirez
Lead Environmental Engineer, OceanTech
