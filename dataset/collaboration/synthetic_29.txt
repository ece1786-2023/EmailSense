Subject: Follow-up: Industrial Collaboration Proposal with Jackson Engineering

Content:
Dear Professor Anderson,

I trust you are doing well since our last conversation. I'm writing to follow up on our discussion regarding the proposed collaboration between your lab and Jackson Engineering.

As we are moving forward with the project timeline, I wanted to check in and see if you've had the chance to review the memorandum of understanding I sent last week. Your feedback would be invaluable in finalizing the terms of our partnership.

Please let me know if there are any points you'd like to discuss or if you need further information from our end. We are keen to commence this exciting venture with your esteemed research group.

Looking forward to your response.

Best,
Tom Richards
Director of R&D
