Subject: Follow-Up: Bioengineering Collaboration Proposal

Content:
Dear Prof. Thompson,

I trust this email finds you well. I am Dr. Rita Sanchez from NexGen Pharma, and I am reaching out to follow up on our previous correspondence regarding the bioengineering collaboration proposal I sent you on March 15.

As we are approaching the grant application deadline, I wanted to ensure that you received all the necessary documentation and see if you have any further questions or require additional information.

Your contribution to our project on personalized medicine would be significant, and we are hopeful for your participation. Please let me know if there's anything more I can provide to facilitate your decision.

Looking forward to your response.

Best,
Dr. Rita Sanchez
Director of Research Partnerships
