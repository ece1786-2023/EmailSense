Subject: Inquiry for Potential Research Collaboration with ACME Robotics

Content:
Dear Prof. Smith,

I hope this email finds you well. I am Dr. Thomas Green, the head of R&D at ACME Robotics. We are currently exploring opportunities for collaboration in the field of robotics and AI. Given your expertise in robotic control systems and your reputable research group at Stanford University, I believe a joint project could lead to mutually beneficial outcomes.

We are particularly interested in the integration of machine learning techniques to improve robotic responsiveness in complex environments. I would love to discuss how we might collaborate on this, potentially co-supervising Ph.D. students or co-authoring research papers.

Could we set up a meeting to explore this possibility further? I am available for a video conference next week, or I could arrange a visit to your campus.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
Dr. Thomas Green
Head of R&D, ACME Robotics
