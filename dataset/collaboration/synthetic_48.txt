Hi Prof. Davis,

Just wanted to say thank you again for your engaging presentation at Widget Corp's Innovation Conference last week. Your talk on the 'Future of Wearable Tech' sparked a lot of discussions among our teams here.

Could we set up a time next week to talk about how your research lab could collaborate with Widget Corp on a new line of smart wearables? We're very excited about the potential synergy between our work.

Thanks once more, and I look forward to connecting soon!

Best,
Alex Thompson
Head of Product Development, Widget Corp
