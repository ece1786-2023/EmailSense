Subject: Inquiry About Joint Research Grant Opportunities

Content:
Hi Dr. Taylor,

I'm Prof. Emily Rios from the University of St. Andrews, and I specialize in sustainable materials engineering. I came across your recent publication on bio-degradable polymers and was thoroughly impressed with the innovative approach you've taken.

I'm writing to inquire if you'd be interested in exploring joint research grant opportunities. I believe that by combining our expertise, we could develop new sustainable materials that could revolutionize several industries.

I'm particularly keen on applying for the upcoming EU research funds for sustainability, and I think we have a solid chance to secure a grant with a strong proposal. Let me know if this interests you and we can start brainstorming ideas.

Best,
Emily Rios
