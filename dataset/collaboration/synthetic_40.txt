Subject: Inquiry on Collaborative Grant Application for Smart City Development

Content:
Professor Green,

I am reaching out to you from UrbanTech, a technology firm that specializes in smart city solutions. Your research on urban informatics and smart infrastructure management is of great interest to us, especially in light of the upcoming Smart City Challenge grant offered by the government.

We are currently putting together a multidisciplinary team to apply for this grant and would like to invite you to join as our academic partner. Your input would be critical to the success of our proposal. Can we set up a meeting next Thursday to discuss this in more detail and see if our goals align?

Looking forward to the opportunity of potentially collaborating with you.

Best,
Michael Peterson
Director of Innovation, UrbanTech
