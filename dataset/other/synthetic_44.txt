Subject: Urgent: Permission Required for Yearbook Photo Inclusion

Content:
Dear Professor Reed,

My name is Sarah and I'm part of the editorial team for the upcoming university yearbook. We've noticed a wonderful picture of you at the recent Faculty Gala and would love to include it in our "Professors of the Year" section. Could we have your permission to use this photo?

Please note that our deadline for submissions is this Friday. Your prompt response would be greatly appreciated to ensure we can include your photo in the yearbook.

Looking forward to your positive response.

Warm regards,
Sarah Chen
Yearbook Committee
