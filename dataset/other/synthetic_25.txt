Dear Professor Smith,

This is a reminder for the upcoming annual Charity Marathon supporting local schools. We are still in need of volunteers and participants! The event will take place on April 23rd and it would be fantastic if the university faculty could be represented. Any level of participation would be deeply appreciated.

Best regards,
Samantha Dale
Coordinator, Community Outreach Programs
