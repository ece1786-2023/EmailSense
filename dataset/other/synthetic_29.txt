Hi Prof. Smith,

The City Museum is about to launch an exhibit on the cultural impact of modern technology, and we're seeking insights from experts like you. Would you be willing to preview the exhibit and share your thoughts? Your feedback would be extremely helpful before the public opening next month.

Best,
