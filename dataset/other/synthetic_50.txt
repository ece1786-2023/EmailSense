Subject: Book Club Invitation

Content:
Hi Professor Davis,

Hope all is well. I'm excited to let you know that we're forming a book club within the faculty, and we'd be thrilled to have you join us! Our first meeting is next Thursday at the local library, and we're starting with "The Silent Patient." Interested?

See you there!
Olivia
