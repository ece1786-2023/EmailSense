Dear Computer Science students,
 
The School of Computer Science – your School – is turning 50 this year, and we are planning a major celebration event on Oct. 21 and 22, including talks by famous alumni (e.g. AI guru Yoshua Bengio and Ron Bodkin (previously head of Data Science at Google)), cocktail, poster session, programming competition and more. I invite you to participate and take advantage of the events to network with alumni, professors, and fellow students.
