Subject: Final Call for Poetry Slam Judges!

Hello Professor Daniels,

Our annual campus Poetry Slam is just around the corner, and we are in dire need of judges! Given your love for literature, we thought you'd be a perfect fit for the panel. The event is on March 15th, and it would mean the world to the participants to have your expertise.

Let me know if you can make it!

Best,
