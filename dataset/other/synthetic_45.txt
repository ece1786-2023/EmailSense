Subject: Apartment Available for Sublet

Content:
Good afternoon Prof. Anderson,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to let you know that I'm subletting my apartment over the summer and thought you might know some visiting scholars or new faculty who are in need of a place. It's fully furnished, close to campus, and available from June to August.

Thanks for passing along the info!

Best,
Jordan
