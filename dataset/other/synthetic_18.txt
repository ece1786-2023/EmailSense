Dear Professor Robertson,

I hope this message finds you in good spirits. I am at a crossroads in my life, and I could really use some of the wisdom you shared in our philosophy lectures. Would you be willing to meet for a coffee sometime next week? I'd greatly appreciate your guidance.

Sincerely,
