Good morning Professor Smith,

Starting next week, we'll be offering yoga classes every Wednesday at the campus wellness center. These sessions are designed to help faculty and students manage stress and maintain a healthy work-life balance. It would be great to have you join us and maybe even de-stress a bit!

Namaste,
