Hey Prof. Jenkins,

Hope you're doing well! I couldn't resist sharing some exciting news with you. My band, The Quantum Beats, is going to be performing at the local Phoenix club this Saturday at 8 pm. I know you mentioned enjoying live music, so I thought I'd extend the invitation.

Would be awesome to see a familiar face in the crowd!

Rock on,
