Subject: Need Your Expert Opinion!

Content:
Hello Prof. Smith,

I've recently come across an article on Quantum Computing and, knowing that's your area of expertise, I was wondering if I could get your opinion on it. The article is from 'Tech Today' magazine and delves into quantum encryption methods. I'm no expert, but the topic has piqued my interest. Could you spare a few minutes for a brief chat over coffee next week?

Cheers,
