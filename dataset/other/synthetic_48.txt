Hi Professor,

I'm excited to share that my photography will be featured in the upcoming "Visions & Viewpoints" exhibition at the Greenfield Art Gallery. Your insights in the Visual Studies classes have been immensely influential in my work, and it would be an honor to have you attend the opening night.

The event is next Thursday, 14th April at 7:00 PM. There'll be wine, good conversation, and hopefully, some thought-provoking art! No RSVP needed, just bring your passion for the arts.

Hope to see you there,
Jessie Caldwell
