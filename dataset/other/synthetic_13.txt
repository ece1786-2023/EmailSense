Subject: Lost Eyeglasses in Lecture Hall

Content:
Hi Prof. Miller,

I'm sorry to bother you, but I believe I may have left my eyeglasses in your lecture hall yesterday. They are black-framed, and I was sitting in the third row from the front. If by any chance you come across them, could you please let me know?

Thank you for your time!

Sincerely,
Tom Kline
