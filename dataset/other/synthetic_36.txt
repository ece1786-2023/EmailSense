Subject: Fwd: Reunion Party Photos Attached!

Content:
Hey Prof. James,

Here are the photos from last week's reunion party. Can you believe it's been 10 years since our cohort graduated? It was great catching up with you and reminiscing about the good ol' days in the lab.

Take a look at the pictures and feel free to share them with the rest of the group!

All the best,
