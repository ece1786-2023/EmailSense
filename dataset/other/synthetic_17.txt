Good Morning Prof. Hernandez,

I'm organizing a small brunch this coming Saturday at my place to celebrate the end of the semester. It's just going to be a casual get-together with a few colleagues from the department. It would be lovely if you could join us.

Please let me know if you're available.

Warm regards,
Sylvia Porter
