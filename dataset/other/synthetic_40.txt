Dear Esteemed Professor Lee,

It is with great pleasure that we extend to you an invitation to our annual Charity Gala. This year, we're focusing on raising funds for student scholarships, a cause close to all of our hearts.

The gala is scheduled for June 5th at the Grand Ballroom, Marriot Downtown. We would be honored if you could attend and perhaps even say a few words.

RSVP by May 20th to secure your spot.

Kindest regards,
Jonathan Gold
Dean of Students
