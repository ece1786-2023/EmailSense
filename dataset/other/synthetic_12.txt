Hello Dr. Walker,

We are excited to announce the Annual Alumni Golf Outing, which will be held at the Springfield Country Club on June 15th, 2023. This fun-filled day is a great way to connect with former classmates, faculty, and the broader University community.

We would be honored to have you join us for a round of golf, followed by dinner and a short award ceremony. Please let us know if you can make it by May 20th.

Looking forward to your response.

Warm regards,
Jim Bancroft
Alumni Relations Coordinator, State University
