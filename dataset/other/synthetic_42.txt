Dear Professor Williams,

I hope this email finds you in good health and spirits. As a member of the Springfield community, I wanted to remind you that the annual Charity Marathon on May 14th is fast approaching, and we are eager to support our local children's hospital. It would be an honor to have you join our team of runners or even cheer us on!

Please be aware that the registration deadline is April 30th, and spots are filling up quickly. Let me know as soon as possible if you're interested, so I can ensure you have all the necessary details and we can secure your place.

Looking forward to your prompt response.

Best regards,
Emma
(Event Organizer)
