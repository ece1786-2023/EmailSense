Subject: Change in Book Club Meeting Schedule

Content:
Hello Professor Smith,

Just a heads-up that the University Book Club meeting has been moved to the first Thursday of every month rather than Wednesdays. The decision was made to accommodate more membersâ€™ schedules. Our next meeting will be discussing "The Midnight Library" by Matt Haig. Hope to see you there!

Kindly,
Sarah Connors
Book Club President
