Good Morning All,
 
Re:  Bahen Door Issues
 
Please note, the Interflex door access system is still not working for Bahen’s St. George St. exterior and some interior doors, including the ECE’s Student Common Room in BA 1120.
 
The Lock shop has installed temporary door openers on the push bars to allow building access during regular building hours (8:00 am – 10:00 pm).
If the issue has not been resolved, Caretaking will remove the temporary door openers on the exterior door push bars to secure building.  
 
IMPORTANT:  Bahen occupants who leave their office to exit the building outside of regular building hours (10:00 pm-8:00 am), will not get back into the building
                     	… unless occupant uses their T-Card to access the Patio/ south doors
 
I will keep you all updated with any progress.
 
Thanx,
Gloria
