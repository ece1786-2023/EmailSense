Subject: Invitation to Our Wedding

Content:
Dear Professor Lewinsky,

I hope this message finds you well. My partner and I are excited to announce that we are getting married this summer and it would be an honor for us to have you join us on our special day. You have been such an important part of my journey through college, and I couldn't imagine celebrating without you there.

Please let me know if you can make it, so I can send you the official invitation.

Warm regards,
Sarah Kingston
