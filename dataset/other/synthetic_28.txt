Dear Professor Smith,

I hope this message finds you well. As a follow-up to my previous email, I'm writing to remind you that we require a confirmation of your participation by April 15th to finalize our schedule for the High School Career Day on June 12th. Your expertise in environmental science is highly anticipated by our students and faculty. We would greatly appreciate it if you could take 30 minutes for a presentation, followed by a Q&A session. Please let us know your availability at your earliest convenience.

With respect,
Linda Morris
Career Counselor
