Hi Professor Collier,

I hope this message still finds you well. As a reminder, the Boston University Alumni Association's Networking Event is this coming Thursday evening, and it's important that we finalize the attendee list. We need to confirm your attendance by tomorrow at noon to ensure we have an accurate count for refreshments and materials.

Looking forward to your prompt response and hoping you can join us to enrich the evening with your presence.

Kind Regards,
