Subject: Initial Inquiry: Reference for Research Position

Content:
Hello Dr. Bennett,

My name is James Chu, and I am currently a junior in your Quantum Mechanics course. I've been greatly inspired by your work and dedication, and it has motivated me to pursue research opportunities.

This summer, I am looking to apply for a research assistant position in Quantum Computing at TechInnovate Labs. Your recommendation would greatly enhance my application as they value practical experience and academic insight.

Would you be willing to provide a reference for me? I am more than happy to discuss this further at your convenience.

Sincerely,
James Chu
