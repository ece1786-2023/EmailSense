Subject: Reference Letter Request
Content;
Good morning Professor  Xu,
First and foremost, I hope you are having a wonderful semester so far. As a former student of yours from the Eco 358 course, I truly do credit your engaging and insightful lectures as being the highlight of my undergraduate years.
With graduate program application deadlines approaching, the reason I am writing this letter is to discern whether you would be willing to support me one last time as my academic referee for my graduate application. I am applying for the global management at university of Hongkong, and it would be an immense honour to have your endorsement as my academic referee.
As I understand this may be a busy time for you, I want to assure you it will require only a minimal amount of your time, yet it would be a profound sentiment for me. Should you have any questions regarding it, please do not hesitate to reach out to me.


Sincerely,
Ruijie Zhang
