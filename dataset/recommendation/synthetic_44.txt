Subject: Heartfelt Thanks for Your Recommendation!

Dear Dr. Clarke,

I just wanted to take a moment to express my deepest gratitude for the recommendation letter you provided for my Masterâ€™s application at MIT. Your guidance throughout my undergraduate research was instrumental, and I have no doubt that your support in my application played a significant role in my acceptance.

I'm beyond excited to start this new chapter and I hope to make you proud. Please let me know if there's ever a way I can assist you in the future.

With heartfelt thanks,
Liam W.
