Subject: Follow-Up: Recommendation Letter for PhD Position

Content:
Hello Professor Wilson,

I trust you're doing well. I wanted to follow up on our previous conversation regarding the recommendation letter for my application to the PhD program in Physics at the University of Cambridge. The deadline is approaching in two weeks, and I was hoping to confirm that you are still able to write the letter on my behalf.

I have attached an updated copy of my CV and the draft of my research proposal to this email for your reference. Should you need any further information, please do not hesitate to let me know.

Thank you once again for your support and time on this matter.

Warm regards,
Sophia Green
