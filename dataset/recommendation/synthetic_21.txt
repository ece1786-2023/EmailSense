Subject: Letter of Recommendation for Grad School

Content:
Hi Prof. Smith,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out to you with a somewhat urgent request. As you may remember, I took your Advanced Thermodynamics class last fall and participated in your sustainable energy research group.

I'm currently in the process of applying for the Masters in Mechanical Engineering at MIT, and the deadline is just two weeks away. I realized that a strong letter of recommendation from you, given our past work together, could really strengthen my application.

Could I ask you to write a letter of recommendation for me? If you need any more information or would like to discuss my performance and suitability for the program, Iâ€™d be happy to provide that. I understand this is a short notice, but I'd be incredibly grateful for your help.

I need to submit your letter by the application deadline which is [specific date], so I would greatly appreciate it if you could provide the letter by [specific date - 1 week before the deadline] to ensure there's enough time to include it in my application package.

Thank you very much for considering my request amidst your busy schedule. I am hoping for a positive response by tomorrow or at your earliest convenience so that I can plan accordingly.

Best regards,
Jordan Lee
