Subject: Inquiry for a Letter of Recommendation for Grad School

Content:
Dear Professor Smith,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm Jane Doe, and I had the pleasure of being in your Advanced Molecular Biology course last fall. I'm currently applying for a PhD program in Molecular Biology at Stanford University and was wondering if you would be able to provide a letter of recommendation for me. Your class significantly influenced my research interest, and your insights would be invaluable.

Thank you for considering my request. Please let me know if you require any additional information.

Warm regards,
Jane Doe
