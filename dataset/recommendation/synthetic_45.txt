Subject: Prof. Thompson, could you endorse my skills for a job app?

Hey Prof. Thompson,

It's Alex here â€“ I took your Modern Literature course last fall. I'm applying for a position at a publishing house and thought who better to vouch for my literary analysis skills than you?

It's a bit informal, just a quick email to the hiring team would do the trick. Let me know if you're up for it, no pressure though!

Cheers,
Alex Robinson
