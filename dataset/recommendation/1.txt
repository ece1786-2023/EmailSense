Good Evening Professor Liang, 
 
I hope your day has been pleasant so far! My name is Weizhou Wang, and I had the privilege of taking your ECE421 course during the 2021 winter semester. Firstly, I would like to thank you for the invaluable experience I had during your class, especially given the fact that your insights helped me secure a final grade of 93%. You explained the complex topics, especially the derivation of the machine learning algorithms, in an extremely clear manner. With all those unforgettable lectures you gave us, I made my goal explicit about remaining committed to computer software and artificial intelligence.
 
As I reflect on my academic career, I consider my time in your class to be among the most influential periods of my studies. It was you who built up my interest in this area and gave me the motivation to keep improving myself. As a result, I decided to pursue graduate studies, and I would be genuinely honoured if you were willing to provide an academic reference letter. 
 
I cannot think of anyone else I would rather have as my academic referee, and I am confident that your reference would be of significant benefit in gaining entry to the programs. Should this be something you are open to, please kindly let me know, and I would be happy to send any additional information which you may require!
 
I once again thank you for the exceptional experience I had in your class and for taking the time to consider this request. I hope you have a great rest of your day, and I look forward to hearing from you soon!
 
Sincerely,
Weizhou Wang
