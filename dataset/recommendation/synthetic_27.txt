Hey Prof. Thompson,

I'm in a bit of a bind here. The deadline for the Stanford Data Science program is next week, and I just realized that I need one more letter of recommendation. Remember our late-night data analysis sessions for the AI project last semester? I think you could really speak to my skills and dedication.

Can you help me out with this? I know it's last-minute, but I wouldn't ask if it wasn't seriously important. Let me know what you need from my end.

I should mention that the absolute final date to submit recommendations is this Friday, April 7th. Any chance you could draft something by Thursday, so there's time for any unexpected issues?

Best,
Emily R.
