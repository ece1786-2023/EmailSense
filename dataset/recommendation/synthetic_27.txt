Subject: Grad School Application: Letter of Recommendation Needed Urgently!

Content:
Hey Prof. Thompson,

I'm in a bit of a bind here. The deadline for the Stanford Data Science program is next week, and I just realized that I need one more letter of recommendation. Remember our late-night data analysis sessions for the AI project last semester? I think you could really speak to my skills and dedication.

Can you help me out with this? I know it's last-minute, but I wouldn't ask if it wasn't seriously important. Let me know what you need from my end.

Best,
Emily R.
