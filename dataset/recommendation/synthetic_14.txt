Subject: Inquiry for a Reference Letter for Master's Program

Content:
Hello Professor Lee,

I trust you are doing well. My name is Jacob Daniels, and I was in your Statistical Learning course last fall. I am reaching out to inquire if you would be willing to provide a reference letter for me as I apply for the Masterâ€™s program in Data Science at Stanford University.

I was particularly inspired by your lectures on machine learning and am eager to delve deeper into this field. I believe your recommendation would be highly influential due to your expertise and my academic performance in your class.

I have attached my academic transcript and my statement of purpose for your review. The deadline for the application is May 30th. Please let me know if you need any additional information or if you would like to discuss this further.

Thank you for considering my request.

Best regards,
Jacob Daniels
