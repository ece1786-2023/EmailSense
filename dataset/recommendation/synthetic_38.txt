Dear Professor Thompson,

I just wanted to take a moment to express my heartfelt thanks for writing that recommendation letter for my scholarship application. It truly meant a lot to me to have your endorsement. I'm eagerly waiting for the results, and I'm hopeful.

Thanks once again for your time and support. It is greatly appreciated.

Sincerely,
Emily Johnson
