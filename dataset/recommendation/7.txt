Subject: Letter of Recommendation for UBC & McMaster
Content:
Hello Prof Varro,
 
I hope this email finds you well!
 
I am Isabella Hao, I asked you for a letter of recommendation during the summer.
 
I have submitted my applications for Master’s degree at UBC and McMaster University. The universities’ application system should have sent you a request for a letter of recommendation a while back.
 
I would like to remind you that it is close to the deadline for submitting my letters of recommendation. Could you please find time to submit them? Thank you so much!
 
Sincerely,
 
Isabella Hao
