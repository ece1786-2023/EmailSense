Subject: Quick Request for a Job Reference Letter

Content:
Hey Prof. Johnson,

I'm in a bit of a bind and was hoping you could help me out. It's Mike, from your Econ 101 class last semester. I've got this job opportunity at a startup and they are asking for references. Would you be able to whip up a quick reference letter for me? You always said I had a knack for economics, so I'm hoping you can put in a good word!

Let me know what you need from me. 

Cheers,
Mike
