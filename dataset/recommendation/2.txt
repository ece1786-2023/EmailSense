Dear Professor Veneris,
 
I hope this email finds you well! 
 
My name is Weizhou Wang, and I contacted you earlier today to request a reference letter for my graduate applications. First of all, I would like to thank you sincerely for your reply, and for your generous support! I cannot thank you enough for your help, particularly given the busy nature of this period of the semester.
 
I wanted to follow up with you to provide some program-specific information, as the Master of Science in Computational Science and Engineering at Harvard University has a deadline set for December 1st, 9 days from now. It would be genuinely appreciated if you could help me submit a reference through the link sent by the application system to your eecg.utoronto email first.
 
Following this program, there are four more programs that I hope you can submit reference letters for me, whose profiles are listed below, and I will send you the reference links with reminder emails 7-10 days before their deadlines. 
 
Stanford University:
Master of Science in Electrical Engineering (Dec 6th, 2022)
University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign:
Master of Science in Computer Science (Dec 15th, 2022)
University of Toronto:
Master of Applied Science in ECE (Jan 5th, 2023)
University of Waterloo: 
Master of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (Jan 15th, 2023)
 
I have attached a copy of my resume and transcript to this email for your convenience, and would be happy to answer any additional questions you may have! Thank you for your support and have a great rest of your day!
 
Best regards,
Weizhou Wang
