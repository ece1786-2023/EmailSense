Subject: Following Up: Recommendation Letter for Job Application

Content:
Hi Dr. Johnson,

I hope you're doing great. I wanted to follow up on the email I sent last week about a recommendation letter for the Data Analyst position I'm applying for at Analytica Corp. I understand that this is a busy time for you, but I just wanted to gently remind you as the application deadline is coming up on April 15th.

I really appreciated your guidance during the Advanced Data Science project last year, and I believe your endorsement could be a game-changer for me.

Thank you once again for your support and looking forward to your positive response.

Warm regards,
Mark Lee
