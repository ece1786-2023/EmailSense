Subject: Following Up: Letter of Recommendation

Content:
Hi Professor Smith,

I hope you're having a great week. I wanted to touch base regarding the letter of recommendation for my graduate school application to Oxford University. I sent you the details two weeks ago but haven't heard back yet. I'm sure you're swamped with the end-of-semester rush, but the submission deadline is fast approaching, and I'm getting a bit anxious.

Please let me know if there's anything else you need from my end to make the process easier. Thank you once again for agreeing to support my application.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Best,
Mark S.
