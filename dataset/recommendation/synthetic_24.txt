Subject: Inquiry: Prof. Montgomery's Recommendation for Job Application

Content:
Hi Professor Montgomery,

I trust you're doing well. I’m reaching out because I am applying for a position as a Data Analyst at Google, and I remember how impactful your Statistical Methods course was for me last semester.

I’m hoping you might be willing to provide a recommendation for me. Your insight into my abilities, especially during our project on predictive models, would be invaluable. If you need additional details or would like to discuss my performance further, please let me know.

Thank you for considering my request, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best,
Emma Chung
