Subject: Request for Letter of Recommendation for Grad School

Content:
Dear Professor Smith,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm writing to ask if you would be able to provide a letter of recommendation for my application to the Master's program in Environmental Science at Green University. As you may recall, I was in your Environmental Policy class last semester and completed my term paper on renewable energy sources which you found impressive.

The application deadline is fast approaching on May 1st, and I realize this is a significant request on such short notice. If itâ€™s possible for you to provide a letter, could you please let me know by tomorrow morning? An early confirmation would be greatly appreciated as it would allow me to arrange an alternative solution if necessary. Your insight into my abilities and academic performance would be invaluable to my application. Please let me know if this is possible, and I will provide any additional information you may need.

Thank you for considering my request and for your prompt attention to this time-sensitive matter.

Best regards,
Emily Carter
