Subject: Reference Letter Query for Oxford Application

Content:
Dr. Rodriguez,

I trust you're having a good semester. My name is Sarah Patel, and I'm currently a senior in your Contemporary World Literature class. I am in the process of applying for a Masters in Literature at Oxford University and feel that your guidance has been instrumental in my academic development. Could I possibly impose on you to write a letter of recommendation for my application?

I understand if you are too busy, but your endorsement would be incredibly helpful. I'm happy to provide my resume, personal statement, or any other documents you might need.

Warmest regards,
Sarah Patel
