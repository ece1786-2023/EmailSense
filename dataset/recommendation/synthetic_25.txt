Dear Dr. Gonzalez,

I hope you're having a wonderful week! I just wanted to drop a gentle reminder regarding the recommendation letter for my Master's program in Environmental Science at Yale. The submission deadline is approaching on April 15th.

If there's any additional information you need from me or if there's anything I can do to facilitate the process, please feel free to reach out.

Thank you once again for your support and for taking the time to assist me with my academic pursuits.

Warm regards,
Sylvia Kramer
