Subject: Request for Reference Letter for Scholarship Application

Content:
Dear Professor Johnson,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to request a letter of recommendation for the Highbrow Scholarship, which I'm applying for this coming Friday. Having taken your Advanced Macroeconomics course and working as your research assistant last summer, I believe you can provide the committee with a comprehensive understanding of my academic abilities and work ethic. 

I understand this is a last-minute request, and I apologize for the inconvenience. The deadline snuck up on me due to other academic obligations. I've attached my resume, transcript, and a draft of the scholarship essay to this email for your reference. 

If you need any further information or have questions, please let me know. Your support in this process would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for considering my request amidst your busy schedule.

Warm regards,
Emily Tan
