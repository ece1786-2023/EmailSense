Subject: Inquiry About Possible Reference for Internship

Content:
Hello Professor Black,

I'm reaching out because I am in the process of applying for a summer internship with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and I believe a reference from you, my supervisor during the undergraduate research on astrodynamics, would provide invaluable insight into my work ethic and passion for space exploration.

Would you be open to discussing this further? I can provide my resume, a draft of my cover letter, or any other documentation you may need.

Thank you for considering my request, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely,
Kevin Peterson
