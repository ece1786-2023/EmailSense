Subject: Heartfelt Thanks for Your Reference

Content:
Dear Prof. Alexandra,

I hope you're having a great week! I just wanted to drop a quick note to say a huge thank you for the reference letter you wrote for my application to the Rhodes Scholarship. Your words were not only generous but they truly captured my passion for environmental studies, and I am certain they made a strong impression.

Whether I get the scholarship or not, I am truly grateful for your guidance and support throughout this process. It means a lot to me.

Thank you once more!

Warmest wishes,
Tara Jenkins
