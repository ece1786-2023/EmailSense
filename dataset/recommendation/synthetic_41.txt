Subject: Urgent: Recommendation Letter Request for Grad School Deadline

Content:
Hi Prof. Jenkins,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm Jane, one of your former students from the Intro to AI class last spring. With the application deadline for grad school fast approaching (March 30th), I find myself in dire need of a recommendation letter. Your class sparked my passion for AI, which led me to pursue this field further.

Would you be able to write me a letter of recommendation for my application to Stanford's AI program? I've attached my transcript and resume for your reference.

Thanks in advance for considering my request. Your support would mean the world to me.

Best,
Jane Doe
