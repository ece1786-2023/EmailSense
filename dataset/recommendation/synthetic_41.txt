Subject: URGENT: Recommendation Letter Request for Grad School Deadline March 30th

Content:
Hi Prof. Jenkins,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm Jane, one of your former students from the Intro to AI class last spring. With the application deadline for grad school fast approaching (March 30th), I find myself in dire need of a recommendation letter. Your class sparked my passion for AI, which led me to pursue this field further.

Would you be able to write me a letter of recommendation for my application to Stanford's AI program? I've attached my transcript and resume for your reference. I understand this is a last-minute request, but the recommendation letter is due by March 30th, which is just a week away, and I am concerned about meeting this critical deadline.

I need to emphasize that without your endorsement, my application will be incomplete and could be disqualified. I fully grasp that this request comes on very short notice, hence I am reaching out with the utmost urgency. Your immediate response, even if provisional, would be greatly helpful in ensuring that I can submit my application on time.

Thank you profoundly for considering my request on such short notice. Your support at this pivotal moment would be invaluable.

Best regards,
Jane Doe
