Dear Professor Gao,
 
I hope your day has been pleasant so far! My name is Weizhou Wang, and I had the privilege of taking your CSC384 course during the 2022 fall semester. Firstly, I wanted to reach out to express my gratitude for the knowledge and experience I gained in your class. Your clear explanations, well-designed assignments and tests were instrumental in helping me secure a final grade of 99%.
 
This experience has reinforced my interest in computer software and artificial intelligence and has solidified my commitment to pursuing advanced studies in these fields, and I am happy to share that I have recently been admitted to the MScAC program at UofT Computer Science. As part of the admission process, I have been nominated for the Vector Scholarship in Artificial Intelligence (VSAI) for 2023-24. This scholarship is a merit-based entrance award that recognizes exceptional candidates with an AI-focused study path.
 
With that said, I would be genuinely honoured if you were willing to provide an academic reference letter for me as a step in the nomination process. As one of my instructors in a relevant course, I believe that you are well-suited to attest to my abilities and potential in the field of AI. I have attached my CV and transcript for your reference, as well as the scholarship description.
 
I understand that this is a request for your time and expertise, and I greatly appreciate any assistance you are able to provide. If you are open to providing a reference, please let me know and I will send any additional information you may require.
 
I once again thank you for the exceptional experience I had in your class and for taking the time to consider this request. I hope you have a great rest of your day, and I look forward to hearing from you soon!
 
Sincerely,
Weizhou Wang
