Hello Prof Wei,
 
I hope you are staying warm and healthy!
 
This is Isabella from the design project group of Understanding Development Challenges in BlockChain Development by Mining Stack Overflow with you.
 
I am interested in pursuing graduate studies after I graduate from my current software engineering program, most ideally in McGill. I am wondering if it is possible to do so under your supervision?  In addition, can you please be my recommender for my grad school applications? Thank you in advance!
 
Warm regards,
 
Isabella Hao
