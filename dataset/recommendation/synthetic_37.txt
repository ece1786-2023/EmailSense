Subject: Follow-Up: Recommendation Letter for Job Application

Content:
Hi Dr. Martinez,

This is Michael Brown, we spoke last week about a recommendation letter for the data analyst position I'm applying for at Google. I just wanted to touch base and see if you had a chance to send it out. If there's anything you need from me to complete the letter, please don't hesitate to ask. Thank you once again for your support!

Best,
Michael
