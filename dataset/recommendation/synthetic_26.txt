Subject: Seeking Your Endorsement for Graduate Studies

Content:
Dear Professor Smith,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is John Doe, and I had the pleasure of being in your Advanced Microeconomics class in the Spring of 2021. Your lectures were always insightful and have greatly contributed to my decision to pursue a Master's degree in Economics.

As I am currently in the process of applying to graduate programs, I am reaching out to request a letter of recommendation from you. Your endorsement would be invaluable to my application, especially given my strong interest in behavioral economics, a passion that was sparked by the research topics we discussed in your class.

I have attached my resume and personal statement for your reference. If you require any additional information or would like to discuss this further, please let me know. I am happy to accommodate your schedule.

Thank you for considering my request.

Warm regards,
John Doe
