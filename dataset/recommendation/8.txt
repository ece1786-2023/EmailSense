Subject: Isabella Hao_ Inquiry about Being My Recommender
Content:
Dear Professor Varro,
 
I hope you are having a good day!
 
I am Isabella Hao, a student of your winter 2022 ECSE429 class.
Thank you so much for providing interesting and thought-provoking contents in the class. From it, I have learnt many interesting testing techniques.
 
As you probably remember, I mentioned in the interview for your SURE project, I am interested in perusing graduate studies and hopefully here at McGill.  I am now preparing for applying graduate programs, I wonder if you could become my recommender. If a meeting during your office hour or a draft of my resume is needed, please feel free to let me know.
 
Looking forward to your reply. Thank you again for your assistance.
 
Sincerely,
 
Isabella Hao
