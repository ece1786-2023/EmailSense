Subject: Inquiry About Recommendation for Internship Program

Content:
Hello Dr. Reyes,

I hope this email finds you in good health. I am Alex Martin, currently enrolled in your Software Engineering Ethics course. The discussions we've had so far have really enhanced my understanding of the ethical landscape in tech.

I'm reaching out because I am applying for a summer internship with Quantum Computing Inc. and they require a letter of recommendation from a faculty member. Given your extensive background in ethical tech practices and our recent interactions, I believe you could provide a unique perspective on my capabilities and how they align with the internship's focus.

Would you be willing to write a letter of recommendation on my behalf? I can provide all the necessary details and documentation to assist you in this process. The deadline for submission is May 3rd.

Thank you for considering my request. I am looking forward to your response.

Best regards,
Alex Martin
