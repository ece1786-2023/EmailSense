Subject: Following Up: Reference Letter for Job Application

Content:
Dear Professor Greene,

I trust you're having a good week. I'm writing to follow up on my previous email regarding the reference letter for the Data Analyst position I'm applying for at Google. The application deadline is approaching on April 15th, and I wanted to ensure that the letter would be submitted on time.

Please let me know if there's any further information you need from me to complete the reference.

Thank you once again for your support.

Best wishes,
Jordan Lee
