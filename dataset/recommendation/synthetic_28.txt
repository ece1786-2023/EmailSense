Subject: Follow-Up on Recommendation Request

Content:
Hello Dr. Wilson,

I wanted to touch base regarding the recommendation letter for my job application at Orbital Technologies. We discussed this briefly after your lecture last Thursday. I truly appreciate your willingness to support my application by providing a reference.

The deadline is fast approaching, on April 18th, and I just wanted to check in to see if you need any further information from me. I have attached my updated CV and a draft of the cover letter for your convenience.

Please let me know if there's anything else I can provide.

Sincerely,
Raj Patel
