Dear Dr. Garcia,

I just received a notification that you've submitted the recommendation letter for my job application at Veritas Technologies. I can't express enough how much your support means to me during this crucial step in my career.

I thoroughly enjoyed our collaboration on the solar energy project during my final year, and I believe your mentorship has been pivotal in shaping my professional aspirations.

Thank you once again for taking the time to support my application. I will keep you updated on the outcome!

Warmly,
Sophia Rojas
