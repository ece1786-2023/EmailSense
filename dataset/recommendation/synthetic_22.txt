Subject: Letter of Recommendation for John Avery

Content:
Dear Professor Johnson,

I hope you are doing well. I am reaching out to request a letter of recommendation. I had the pleasure of being in your Intro to Philosophy class in 2019, and since then, I've completed my B.A. with a major in Philosophy.

I'm applying to several law schools and believe a letter from you would not only be fitting but could also be influential given the critical thinking and ethical debates we had in class that have directed my career aspirations.

I can provide my resume, personal statement, and any other information you might find useful. Your support would mean a lot to me.

Thank you for considering my request.

Warmest regards,
John Avery
