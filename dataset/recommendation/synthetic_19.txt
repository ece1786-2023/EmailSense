Subject: Reference Letter Submission Confirmation

Content:
Dear Dr. Martinez,

I hope you're doing well. I just wanted to confirm whether you've sent out the recommendation letter for my application to the Rhodes Scholarship. The selection committee informed me that they are finalizing applications and should receive all materials by the end of this week.

Your support is crucial for me, and I want to make sure everything is in order.

Thank you again for your time and assistance.

Best regards,
Sarah Chen
