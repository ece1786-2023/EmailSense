Subject: Recommendation Letter - Thank You and Follow Up

Content:
Dear Professor Davis,

I just wanted to extend my heartfelt gratitude for agreeing to write a letter of recommendation for me for my recent application to the Fulbright Scholarship. Your support throughout the process was invaluable, and I am anxiously awaiting the results.

Could I trouble you for a quick update on the submission of the recommendation letter? The Fulbright committee mentioned they are missing some documents, and I want to ensure everything is on track.

Thank you once again for your time and assistance.

Sincerely,
Alice Wang
