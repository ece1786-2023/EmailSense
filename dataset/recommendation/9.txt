Subject: Western University Letter of Recommendation
Content:
Hello Lili,
 
I hope everything is going well for you!
 
I have just been informed that Western University will request another submission of the same letter of recommendation, due to some issues with their internal processing procedure. They have or will send you another request through email. Please kindly submit another copy 😊
 
Sorry for bothering you, and thank you for your time and effort!
 
Sincerely,
 
Isabella Hao
