Subject: Gentle Reminder: Recommendation Letter for Internship

Content:
Hi Prof. Thompson,

I hope you're doing well. Just wanted to send a gentle reminder about the recommendation letter for my summer internship application with NASA. The deadline is April 15th, and I remember you mentioned having a lot on your plate, so I thought a quick reminder might be helpful.

If thereâ€™s any additional information you need about the internship or my involvement in your Quantum Computing seminar, please let me know. Thank you again for your help!

Best wishes,
Derek L.
