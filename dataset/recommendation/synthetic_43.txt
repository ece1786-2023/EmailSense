Subject: Follow-Up: Recommendation Letter for Oxford Scholarship

Content:
Dear Professor Smith,

I'm writing to follow up on the email I sent two weeks ago regarding a letter of recommendation for the Rhodes Scholarship at Oxford. I understand how busy the semester can get, so I wanted to gently remind you of the deadline on April 15th.

If you require additional information from my side to assist with the letter, please let me know.

Thank you once again for your invaluable support.

Warm regards,
Samantha Green
