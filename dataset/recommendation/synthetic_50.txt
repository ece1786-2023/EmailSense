Subject: Request for Reference for Internship Application

Content:
Good Morning Professor Morales,

I hope this email finds you in the best of health and spirits. My name is James Lee, and I am currently in your "International Relations" course. As part of my degree requirements, I'm seeking an internship with the United Nations, and they've asked for an academic reference.

Considering our engaging discussions and your expertise in the field, I believe that your recommendation could significantly strengthen my application. If you agree, I would like to provide you with my personal statement and any other documentation you may need.

Please let me know if this is possible and if you have any conditions for providing such a reference.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,
James Lee
