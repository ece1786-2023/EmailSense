Subject: Checking In â€“ Ref Letter for Job Application

Content:
Hello Dr. Petersen,

Hope you're having a great week. This is Michael from your 2021 Robotics Seminar. I recently applied to Boston Dynamics, and they've asked for references. I immediately thought of you, given the robotic arm project we worked on together.

If you have the time, could you provide a reference letter for me? No rush, the deadline is in a month. I'd be happy to meet or chat if you need any updates on my work since your class.

Thanks a lot,
Michael Taylor
