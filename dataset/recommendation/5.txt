Subject: Reference Letter Request
Content:
Hello, dear professor Donar, 
 
My name is Ruijie Zhang, may I ask that if you could help me to complete the reference form from HongKong University?   
The reference letter mode of that program may be different from others. You can download the attached document, and then fill in the last 2 pages (pg4&5). And the final step is to email the document to MGMref@hku.hk.  
The deadline for submission is March 5th, I apologize about telling you so late. I was just refused by Ivey business program several days before and I decided to try the HongKong University.I would be truly appreciate if you could help me to finish it. Thank you so much dear professor. If you have any question, please feel free to email me. Have a nice day. 
 
Sincerely, 
Ruijie Zhang
