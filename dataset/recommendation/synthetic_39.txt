Subject: Reminder: Reference Letter Request for Masters Program

Content:
Professor Lee,

I hope you are doing well. I'm Alex Kim, one of your former students from the Environmental Science seminar. As the application deadline for the Masters program at University of British Columbia is approaching, I am reaching out to kindly remind you of the reference letter you agreed to write on my behalf. Please let me know if there's any information you need from me. Your support is crucial for my application, and I am very thankful for it.

Best wishes,
Alex Kim
