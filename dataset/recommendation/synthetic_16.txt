Subject: Request for Letter of Recommendation for Grad School Application

Content:
Dear Professor Johnson,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Emily Smith, and I was fortunate enough to take your Advanced Theoretical Physics course last spring. I am currently in the process of applying for a Ph.D. program in Physics at MIT and I am reaching out to ask if you would be willing to provide a letter of recommendation for me.

Your course profoundly influenced my academic trajectory, and I believe that your endorsement would significantly strengthen my application. I would be happy to provide you with any additional information you may need to assist in writing the letter.

Thank you very much for considering my request.

Warm regards,
Emily Smith
