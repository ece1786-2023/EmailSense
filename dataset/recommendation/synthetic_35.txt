Subject: Reference Letter Needed for Study Abroad Application

Content:
Hi Professor Garcia,

I hope all is well with you. I'm writing to request a letter of recommendation for my study abroad application to the University of Oxford's International Relations program. Having taken your Global Politics course, I believe your perspective on my academic performance and passion for international affairs would greatly benefit my application.

The submission deadline is on June 10th, and I can provide you with my resume, personal statement, and any other material that might be helpful.

Thank you for considering my request and I look forward to your favorable response.

Best,
Olivia Sanchez
