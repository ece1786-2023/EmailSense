Subject: Scheduling Annual Performance Review
Content:
Dear Dr. Williams,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to remind you of the upcoming annual performance review process for your department. As per university guidelines, each faculty member is required to submit a self-assessment report by May 15th.

Please let me know if you have any questions regarding the documentation required or if you'd like to discuss your achievements and contributions before the final submission. Your cooperation in completing this on time is greatly appreciated.

Warm regards,
Jennifer Smith
Administrative Assistant, College of Sciences
