Subject: Urgent: Venue Change for Tomorrow’s Department Meeting

Content:
Dear Professor Bennett,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to bring to your attention an important last-minute change regarding our monthly department meeting scheduled for tomorrow at 10:00 AM.

Due to a double booking error, our usual meeting room in the Watson Building is unavailable. We’ve managed to secure Room 204 in the Hargreaves Hall for our meeting instead. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and kindly ask you to inform any colleagues that might not have seen this email.

Thank you for your understanding, and I look forward to seeing you there.

Best regards,
Hannah Forrester
Department Secretary
University of Riverdale
