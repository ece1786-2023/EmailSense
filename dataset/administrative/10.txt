Subject: Inquiry for Possible Research Position
Content:
Dear Dr. Bruin,


I am a first-year UCLA undergraduate student majoring in Psychology. I wish to enroll in the Student Research Program (SRP) 99 Contract Course administered by the Undergraduate Research Center–Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences. The program offers course units for research completed under the guidance of a UCLA faculty mentor.


I see by your faculty page that your research and teaching interests include stress in the workplace, and I recently read your article in Psychology Research entitled “Stress Analysis in the Workplace.”My research interests focus on the psychological impact of driving in Los Angeles, and I would like to explore how individual commutes could be a possible ‘upstream’ cause of workplace stress.


I would greatly appreciate an opportunity to meet with you to discuss the possibility of enrolling in an SRP 99 research course with you for the upcoming quarter. I am available on Tuesdays and Fridays after 2:00 p.m. for a meeting or interview. Please find my CV attached for your review. 


I appreciate your time and consideration.


Respectfully,


Student’s Name
