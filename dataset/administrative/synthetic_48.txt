Dear Students,

Please note that my office hours scheduled for Thursday, April 8th, will be moved to Friday, April 9th from 2 PM to 4 PM due to a mandatory department meeting. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

If you are unable to attend the rescheduled office hours and need to discuss urgent matters, feel free to email me to arrange an alternative appointment.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best,
Professor Jonathan Walker
