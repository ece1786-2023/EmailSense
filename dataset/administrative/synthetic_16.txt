Dear Professor Williams,

I hope this message finds you well. Due to an unforeseen scheduling conflict, we urgently need to reschedule the budget review meeting initially set for March 15th. Could you please provide your availability next week so we can align on a new time?

This meeting is critical for the upcoming fiscal year planning, and your input is highly valuable. I apologize for the inconvenience and appreciate your understanding and prompt response.

Best regards,
James Carter
