Subject: Annual Community Service Event Participation

Content:
Dear Prof. Thomas,

Greetings! Our universityâ€™s annual community service day is fast approaching, and this year, we are aiming to involve as many faculty members as possible. The event will be held on April 15th, and we will be partnering with local organizations to clean up public parks and plant trees around the campus neighborhood.

Your participation would not only be greatly appreciated but would also set a fine example for students and other faculty members. Please let me know if you can join us, and feel free to invite your research team as well.

Looking forward to a positive response.

All the best,
Olivia Spencer
Director of Community Engagement
Ashton College
