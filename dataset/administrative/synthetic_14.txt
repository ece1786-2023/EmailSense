Subject: Important: Compliance Training Deadline Approaching

Content:
Hello Professor Andersson,

This is a friendly reminder that the deadline to complete the mandatory compliance training on "Ethical Conduct in Research" is quickly approaching on May 1st. As a faculty member engaged in research, it is essential that you complete this training to remain in good standing with the university's research governance policies.

The training module can be accessed through the university portal and should take approximately two hours to complete. If you have any trouble accessing the training or have questions about the content, please don't hesitate to contact my office for support.

Thank you for your attention to this important matter.

Best wishes,
Carolyn Joyce
