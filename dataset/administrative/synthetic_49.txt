Subject: Follow-Up: Faculty Research Grant Application

Content:
Dear Prof. Lin,

I trust you are well. I am following up on the research grant application that you had expressed interest in during our last conversation. The deadline for submitting the application is approaching on April 25th, and I wanted to check in to see if you might need any assistance with the paperwork or clarification on the guidelines.

As this grant could significantly support your current research project on renewable energy solutions, I am eager to help you secure this opportunity. Please let me know if there is anything I can do to facilitate the process.

Best wishes,
Laura Stevens
Research Support Officer
