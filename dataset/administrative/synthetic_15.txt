Subject: Conference Room Booking Confirmation - May 12th

Prof. Thompson,

I wanted to confirm your booking for the main conference room on May 12th for the "Innovations in Biotechnology" roundtable discussion. The room is reserved for you from 8 AM to 5 PM. We've arranged for the AV equipment setup as requested, and catering services have been notified to provide refreshments during the event.

If there are any additional requirements or changes to the schedule, please let me know by the end of this week so we can make the necessary arrangements.

Kind regards,
Lisa Patel
