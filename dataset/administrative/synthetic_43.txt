Dear Professor Roberts,

I hope all is well. This is to inform you that the annual budget review meeting for faculty research funds has been scheduled for April 12th, from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM in the main boardroom. During this meeting, we will discuss the allocation of resources for the upcoming fiscal year, as well as any changes to departmental funding priorities.

Your presence and input as a senior member of the research committee are highly valuable. Please confirm your attendance at your earliest convenience. Should you have any preliminary points or agenda items to discuss, do not hesitate to bring them forward before the meeting.

Best,
Kevin Hughes
