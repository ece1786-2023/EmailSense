Subject: Parking Permit Renewal Due for Upcoming Academic Year

Content:
Professor Jackson,

I wanted to remind you that the deadline for faculty parking permit renewals is approaching on May 31st. To avoid any delays or issues for the upcoming academic year, please ensure that your application is submitted through the university's parking services portal by this date.

If you have any questions about the renewal process or encounter any technical difficulties, don't hesitate to reach out to the Parking Services office for assistance.

Best,
Haley Finn
