Dear Professor Hensley,

I hope this message finds you well. This is a gentle reminder that we will be holding our annual Departmental Budget Review meeting next Tuesday, April 18th, at 3:00 PM in Conference Room B. Your presence is crucial as we will discuss the upcoming fiscal year's budget allocations and any adjustments needed in response to department needs and university guidelines.

Please ensure you have reviewed the preliminary budget documents sent out last week. Your insights and suggestions are invaluable, and we would greatly appreciate your input during this discussion. Let me know if you need any further information prior to the meeting.

Looking forward to your participation.

Best regards,
Diane Kerr
