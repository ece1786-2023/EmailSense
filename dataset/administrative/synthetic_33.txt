Subject: Update on Budget Allocation for Research Assistants

Content:
Professor Gonzalez,

I hope your research is progressing well. I wanted to touch base with you regarding the budget for the upcoming fiscal year. As you know, the department has been under pressure to adjust our expenditures due to university-wide budget cuts.

Unfortunately, this means a reduction in the funds allocated for research assistants in your project. We need to meet to discuss how we can best manage these changes without impacting your work significantly. Could you please suggest a few times next week that would be convenient for you to discuss this matter?

I apologize for any inconvenience and look forward to finding a workable solution.

Warm regards,
Janet Lin
Departmental Finance Officer
