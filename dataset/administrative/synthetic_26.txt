Subject: Urgent Room Change for Tomorrow's Lecture

Content:
Dear Professor Goodwin,

I hope this email finds you well. Due to an unforeseen issue with the HVAC system in Hall B, your lecture scheduled for tomorrow at 10:00 AM has been relocated to Room 204 in the East Wing. Facilities management has assured me that this will be a temporary arrangement and they expect repairs to be completed by next week.

My apologies for the short notice and any inconvenience this may cause. Please let your students know about this change as soon as possible. 

Warm regards,

Jessica Ray
Academic Coordinator
