Subject: Notice of Faculty Meeting to Discuss Student Feedback Mechanism

Content:
Dear Colleagues,

I would like to invite you to a faculty meeting on April 15th at 10 AM in the main conference hall to discuss the implementation of a new student feedback mechanism. The student council has expressed the need for a more effective way to communicate their concerns and suggestions directly to the faculty.

Your insights and experiences are invaluable to this process, and I look forward to a productive session where we can collaboratively develop a robust feedback system that benefits our academic community.

Please RSVP by April 10th so that we can arrange the necessary accommodations.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Sincerely,
Dr. Emily Nguyen
Dean of Students
Centennial College
