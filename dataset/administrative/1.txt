Subject: SURE Project Application - ECSE026
Content:
Dear Prof. Varro:
I hope you are having a good day!
I am a U3 student who wishes to apple for your SURE projects, more specifically ECSE026. We spoke after our ECSE429 class. Your description of the program interested me a lot. I have taken a Machine Learning course (COMP551) last fall and am currently taking COMP424 Artificial Intelligence, which matches your research area. I have also had some brief research experience in the Blockchain Lab of the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Science. However, I have only been there for the summer, all I have done were read papers and attend paper conferences in the lab.
I hope to join your research group for the SURE project and hopefully bring the project into a Master's program after I graduate In June 2023.
Sincerely,
 
 Isabella Hao
