Subject: Revised Office Hours Policy Implementation

Content:
Hi Prof. Thomson,

The department has recently revised the policy regarding faculty office hours in an effort to ensure that all students have equitable access to academic support. Starting next semester, each faculty member is required to offer at least one evening session per week for office hours.

I understand that this change may require some adjustments to your current schedule. I would be happy to discuss this with you and find a suitable time that minimizes disruptions to your existing commitments.

Thank you for your cooperation.
Sincerely,
Mark Daniels
Vice-Dean of Academic Affairs
Riverbend College
