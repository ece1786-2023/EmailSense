Subject: Request for Course Scheduling Assistance

Content:
Hi Prof. Gomez,

I'm in a bit of a bind with my course schedule next semester and I've been advised you're the go-to person for sorting these things out. I'm a senior and need to take 'Advanced Thermodynamics' to graduate, but it's clashing with my 'Introduction to Fluid Dynamics' class. I know it's a long shot, but is there any possibility of tweaking the schedule or allowing an exception for me to attend alternate sessions?

Any help or guidance you could offer would be much appreciated. Thanks a ton for your time and assistance.

Warm regards,
Tommy Clarkson
