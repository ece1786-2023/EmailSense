Hello Professor Thompson,

I trust you're doing well. As you may know, the annual Commencement Ceremony is just around the corner, and we are reaching out to faculty members for assistance with the organization and execution of the event.

Your charisma and rapport with the students make you an ideal candidate to help us coordinate the procession and seating. Would you be willing to volunteer for this role on May 15th? 

Please let us know your availability so that we can finalize the event details.

Thank you for considering this request.

Sincerely,
Diana Prince
Events Coordinator
