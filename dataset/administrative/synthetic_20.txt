Subject: Course Timetable Coordination for Fall Semester

Content:
Professor Gupta,

As we begin to prepare for the fall semester, I'd like to request your preferred teaching times for your courses. We're trying to optimize the schedule to minimize conflicts for students and faculty alike.

Your input is essential to finalize the timetable. Please submit your preferences via the online faculty portal by April 10th. If you encounter any issues or have specific constraints, don't hesitate to reach out directly.

Best regards,
Emily Watson
Academic Scheduling Officer
