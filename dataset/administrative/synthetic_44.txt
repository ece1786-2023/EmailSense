Subject: Call for Mentors: Undergraduate Research Program

Content:
Hello Dr. Sanchez,

I hope your week is off to a great start. I am reaching out to inquire if you might be interested in mentoring a student in our Undergraduate Research Program this summer. We are looking for experienced faculty to guide our bright and ambitious students through a 10-week research project in their field of study.

Your expertise in environmental sciences would provide an invaluable learning experience. If you are willing to participate, please let me know by March 20th, and I will send you more details on the next steps.

Thank you for considering this opportunity to make a difference in our students' academic journey.

Warmest regards,
Emily Norton
Program Coordinator
University of California, Berkeley
