Hello Prof. Bennett,

We are excited to announce the 6th Annual Science and Technology Expo and are currently seeking faculty volunteers to lead workshops and demonstrations. The event will take place on campus from April 22-24 and aims to engage the broader community with the innovative work happening at our university.

If you're interested in participating or have a project that you would like to showcase, please respond by April 1st. Your expertise would greatly enhance the experience for attendees and provide valuable exposure for your department.

Warmest regards,
