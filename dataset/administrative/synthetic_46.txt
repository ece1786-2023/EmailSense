Subject: Urgent: Budget Approval Needed for Upcoming Workshop

Content:
Dear Prof. Robinson,

I hope this message finds you well. As the deadline is swiftly approaching, I am writing to remind you of the budget proposal for the upcoming "Data Science in Education" workshop, scheduled for May 15-17, 2023. Your approval is urgently needed to proceed with vendor payments and marketing efforts.

We are currently awaiting your final decision on the proposed budget that was sent to your university email on March 22. Your timely response would greatly assist us in staying on track with our timeline and ensuring a successful event.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Best regards,
Megan Hughes
