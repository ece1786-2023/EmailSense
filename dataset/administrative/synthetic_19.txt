Subject: Facilities Update: Library Renovation Progress

Content:
Good morning Prof. Clarke,

I wanted to update you on the progress of the library's renovation. The construction is moving forward as scheduled, and we expect to reopen the second floor by the end of this month. I understand the temporary reduction in study space has been an inconvenience for your students, and I thank you for your patience.

In the meantime, additional study areas have been arranged in the conference hall. Should you need to direct students to a quiet workspace, please advise them of this alternative.

Thank you,
Karen Peterson
