Subject: Urgent Room Change Notification for Upcoming Lecture

Content:
Dear Prof. Harding,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm writing to inform you of an unexpected but necessary room change for your lecture scheduled for Monday, March 15th. Due to emergency maintenance in Hamilton Hall, your class has been relocated to Room 215 in the Stewart Science Building.

Please notify your students of this change as soon as possible. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding and flexibility.

Best regards,
Evelyn Pierce
