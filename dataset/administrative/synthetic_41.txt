Subject: Room Change for Upcoming Seminar

Content:
Dear Dr. Williams,

I hope this message finds you well. Due to a last-minute maintenance issue in Conference Room B, we need to relocate your seminar scheduled for tomorrow, March 16th, at 2:00 PM. The new location will be the Lecture Hall in Building C, Room 101.

My apologies for any inconvenience this may cause. If there are any specific requirements for the new room setup, please let me know as soon as possible, and I'll ensure everything is arranged accordingly.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

Best regards,
Jenny Carson
