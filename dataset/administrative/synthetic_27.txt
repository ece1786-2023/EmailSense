Hi Dr. Peterson,

Just a quick reminder about our upcoming budget meeting for the Biology Department scheduled for this Thursday at 2 PM in the main conference room. Your input is crucial as we discuss the allocation of department funds for the next fiscal year.

Looking forward to your insights and proposals.
