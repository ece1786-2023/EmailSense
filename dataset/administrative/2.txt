Subject: Seeking Opportunity to Research Medieval and Renaissance Literature
Content: 
Dear Professor Miller,
My name is Allie Springer, and I am an English major in my final semester at the University of Pennsylvania. I am applying to the PURM program and am very interested in your work.
Your theory on the evolution and prevalence of knighthood within Medieval romance is fascinating and thought-provoking. I would love to discuss it in depth with you in relation to my own findings. As an undergraduate focusing on Medieval and Renaissance literature, I have worked on several research projects and presentations. My most recent project has been my Capstone presentation, where I argued the importance of Edmund Spenser's female figures. I hope to expand this project by exploring the allegorical relationships between Spenser's knights and damsels in distress while focusing on the parallels between Britomart and Florimell.
I would love to meet with you to discuss your groundbreaking research at your earliest convenience.
Best regards,
Allie Springer
