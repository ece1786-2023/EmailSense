Subject: Faculty Recruitment Committee Meeting Rescheduled

Content:
Dear Prof. Sterling,

I regret to inform you that the meeting for the Faculty Recruitment Committee originally scheduled for April 25th has been rescheduled due to a conflicting university event. The new meeting date is Thursday, April 27th, from 10:00 to 11:30 AM.

Please update your calendar accordingly. The agenda remains the same, and we will continue our discussion on the prospective candidates for the open tenure-track position in the history department. Your input is valuable to the committee, and we apologize for any inconvenience this change may cause.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best,
Dr. Clara Nguyen
Chair, Faculty Recruitment Committee
