Subject: Student Advisor Role Inquiry

Content:
Hi Dr. Thompson,

I'm reaching out to express my interest in the student advisor position mentioned at the faculty meeting last Thursday. I believe my recent work with the student council on improving campus life could be an asset in this role. Could we meet to discuss this opportunity further?

Thanks for considering my interest. I am looking forward to the possibility of contributing more directly to our students' academic journey.

Warm regards,
