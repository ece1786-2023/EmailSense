Subject: Revision of Curriculum for the Undergraduate Business Program

Content:
Hello Dr. Ahmed,

I hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss the proposed revisions to the undergraduate business program curriculum, which were deliberated in the last faculty meeting. It is crucial to finalize these changes before the start of the new academic year in September.

I would like to schedule a meeting with you and the rest of the curriculum committee to go over the final adjustments. Please let me know your availability next week so we can expedite the process.

Looking forward to your feedback.

Warm regards,
Dr. Susan Choi
Assistant Dean
College of Business and Economics
Northfield University
