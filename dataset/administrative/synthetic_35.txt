Subject: Reminder: Faculty Photoshoot for University Website

Professor Clarke,

Just a gentle reminder that the communications team will be conducting a photoshoot for all faculty members this Thursday, from 1 PM to 3 PM, in the main lobby of the Administration Building. These photographs will be used to update the university website and promotional materials.

Please let us know if this time slot does not work for you so we can arrange an alternative. Weâ€™re aiming for a full turnout to represent our distinguished faculty on our online platforms.

Thanks for your cooperation, and we look forward to seeing you there.

Warmly,
Sophie Martinez
Communications Coordinator
Lakeside University
