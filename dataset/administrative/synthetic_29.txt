Subject: New Policy on Faculty Research Grant Applications

Content:
Dear Dr. Jenkins,

The Research Affairs Office has implemented a new policy regarding the submission of grant applications for faculty research. Beginning next month, all proposals must go through a preliminary review by the department's Grant Oversight Committee prior to submission.

We believe this new policy will increase our success rate and ensure a higher quality of research proposals. Please make sure to factor in this additional step when planning your submission deadlines.

Further details and guidelines will be sent out next week. If you have any immediate questions, feel free to reach out to me.

Best regards,
Michael Clark
Research Affairs Officer
