Dear Dr. Ramirez,

Just a friendly reminder about the upcoming faculty meeting this Thursday at 3 PM in the main conference room. We'll be discussing the new budget allocations, curriculum updates for the next academic year, and the recruitment of adjunct faculty members.

I've attached the agenda and relevant documents for your review. Your input will be invaluable, particularly regarding the new laboratory course proposals. Looking forward to your contributions.

Best,
Dr. Linda Cho
