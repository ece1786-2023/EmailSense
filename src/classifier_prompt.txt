###Instruction###
We would like to develop a machine-learning model for academic email classification to help university professor organize their emails.

Your task is to act as an email classifier to classify the input email into 5 categories: administrative communication emails, industrial collaboration emails, curriculum-related emails, reference letter emails, and all emails that do not fall into the above categories.

1. Reference Letter Requests: Emails that relate to the requests for reference or recommendation letters for the application of graduate studies, scholarships, or applying for jobs. 
2. Curriculum-related Emails: Emails that relate to the courses that a professor is teaching currently, content could be asking a question from a lecture, clarification for assignment instructions, asking when will the grade be released, pointing out mistakes made in class and so on. 
3. Project Collaboration Emails: Emails sent from industry companies or other professors, that regard the collaboration on some projects. 
4. Administrative Communication Emails: Emails that relate to administrative communications. the topic could be related to:
    - Inquiries to join the professorâ€™s research group
    - Overseeing academics and faculty research at colleges and universities
    - Managing research budgets
    - Service to the community: organizing conferences and institute programs (including applying for funding), editorial appointments, refereeing papers, service on grant selection panels and award committees, assessing promotion and tenure cases at other institutions, etc.
    - Coordinating schedules
    - Recruiting new teaching staff and teaching assistants
    - Preparing statistical reports for governments and educational agencies
    - Any other topics that you think are reasonable for administrative-related work
    - The category does not concern any facility malfunctions in the laboratory or school buildings
The emails for the above categories can be an initial email, a follow-up email, or a thank you letter.
5. Others: If you think the email does not belong to the above categories, you can classify it into this category. Some possible topics can be: 
    - Junk email or ads
    - Notification from apps
    - Verification codes
    - Greetings from students/other professors/faculty member
    - Personal invitations from students/alumni

Please first understand the purpose of the whole email, and based on this purpose, perform the classification. Remember that the recipient of the email is a university professor. If you think the target for the email is not a professor, classify it as other. Thank you for your help, you will do great. I have faith in you!

###Format###
Reference Letter Requests: RECOM
Curriculum-related Emails: CURRICULUM
Project Collaboration Emails: COLLAB
Administrative Communication Emails: ADMIN
Others: OTHER

Please also specify the logic of making the classification.

Subject: SURE Project Application - ECSE026
Content:
Dear Prof. Varro:
I hope you are having a good day!
I am a U3 student who wishes to apply for your SURE projects, more specifically ECSE026. We spoke after our ECSE429 class. Your description of the program interested me a lot. I have taken a Machine Learning course (COMP551) last fall and am currently taking COMP424 Artificial Intelligence, which matches your research area. I have also had some brief research experience in the Blockchain Lab of the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Science. However, I have only been there for the summer, all I have done were read papers and attend paper conferences in the lab.
I hope to join your research group for the SURE project and hopefully bring the project into a Master's program after I graduate In June 2023.
Sincerely,
 
Isabella Hao

<ASSISTANT>: ADMIN, because this email is from a student, asking to join the professor's research group.
