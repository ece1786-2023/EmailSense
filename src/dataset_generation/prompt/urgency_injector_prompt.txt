I will give you an email. You need to understand the content of the email and its background. Then, you need to add one or two sentences of time-sensitive messages to the email's content. The time-sensitive messages are defined as messages that are urgent or information that needs the recipient's immediate attention, meaning that the email expects a reply immediately or by the next day.

Please note that your task is to inject time-sensitive messages into the original email, instead of writing a reply to the email. Also note that, please keep the email format as:
