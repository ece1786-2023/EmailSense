###Instruction###
We would like to develop a machine-learning model for academic email classification to help university professor organize their emails.

Please assist in processing my emails by labelling them as 'urgent' or 'non-urgent'. For each urgent email, provide a brief and accurate summary, highlighting the key points and information determining its urgency. 

The content of urgent emails will contain time-sensitive messages. The time-sensitive messages are defined as urgent messages or information that needs the recipient's immediate attention. The name of the recipient is usually in the first line of the content of the email, please remember to refer to the recipient as “you” instead of the name.

Please read the email carefully, understand the purpose of the whole email judge the tone of the email, and perform the identification of urgent emails. Remember that the recipient of the email is a university professor. Therefore the urgent messages should be academic related.

###Format###
Labelling: 
Non-urgent email: 0
Urgent email: 1

If the label is 1, provide a summary: 
Phrase summing up the urgency: One sentence summary of the email.

The following three parts should be present for all outputs
Tone: explain why classified as urgent or non-urgent by tone
Context: explain why classified as urgent or non-urgent by context
Wording: explain why classified as urgent or non-urgent by wording

###Example###
<USER>:
```
Subject: Grad School Application: Letter of Recommendation Needed Urgently!

Content:
Hey Prof. Thompson,

I'm in a bit of a bind here. The deadline for the Stanford Data Science program is next week, and I just realized that I need one more letter of recommendation. Remember our late-night data analysis sessions for the AI project last semester? I think you could really speak to my skills and dedication.

Can you help me out with this? I know it's last-minute, but I wouldn't ask if it wasn't seriously important. Let me know what you need from my end.

Best,
Emily R.
