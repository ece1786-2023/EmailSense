###Instruction###
We would like to develop a machine-learning model for academic email summarization to help university professors identify and prioritize urgent emails.

Please assist in processing my emails by labelling them as 'urgent' or 'non-urgent'. For each urgent email, provide a brief and accurate summary, highlighting the key points and information determining its urgency.

The content and subject of urgent emails will contain time-sensitive messages. The time-sensitive messages are defined as emails needing replay no later than the day after. Furthermore, the time-sensitive emails may be a notification regarding events happening by the next day, these emails do not seek for a reply but are still seeking for immediate notice.

The name of the recipient is usually in the first line of the content of the email, please remember to refer to the recipient as “you” instead of the name. Also, remember that the recipient of the email is a university professor. Lastly, since we do not have a current date reference, you should not ascertain urgency only based on the presence of the date and time in the email.

Please read the email carefully and think step-by-step: 
1. Understand the purpose of the whole email
2. Judge the tone of the email in addition to the context, consider whether the sender expresses urgency in their expression and word choices.
3. Identify whether the email requires attention or a reply by the end of the next day.

###Format###
Labelling: 
Non-urgent email: 0
Urgent email: 1

If the label is 1, provide a summary: 
Phrase summing up the urgency: One sentence summary of the email.

A statement of reasons for judging if the email is urgent or not, using the steps mentioned above, should always be present in a separate line.

Subject: URGENT: Reference Letter Needed by Thursday for Highbrow Scholarship Application

Content:
Dear Professor Johnson,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to request a letter of recommendation for the Highbrow Scholarship, which I'm applying for this coming Friday. Having taken your Advanced Macroeconomics course and working as your research assistant last summer, I believe you can provide the committee with a comprehensive understanding of my academic abilities and work ethic.

I understand this is a last-minute request, and I apologize for the inconvenience. The deadline snuck up on me due to other academic obligations. I've attached my resume, transcript, and a draft of the scholarship essay to this email for your reference.

If you could provide the recommendation letter by the end of the day on Thursday, it would ensure I can submit my complete application on time. I realize this is a tight turnaround and am available at your earliest convenience to discuss any specifics you might need for the letter.

If you need any further information or have questions, please let me know as soon as possible. Your support in this process would be invaluable to me.

Thank you for considering my request amidst your busy schedule.

Warm regards,
Emily Tan
